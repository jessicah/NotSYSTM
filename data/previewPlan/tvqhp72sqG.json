The constant surging below, at, and well above threshold push your ability to recover to the max, making this a fantastic session for building your Anaerobic Capacity (AC). Since you are often forced to \u201Crecover\u201D at high intensities, your cardiovascular system hardly gets a real break, which means your Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) gets pushed hard too. With each effort ending in an all-out sprint, you really get to test out how much you have left in the tank. You might surprise yourself.\n",

Cadence builds improve how you recruit your leg, gluteal, and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke by progressing to your maximal cadence. By reaching your highest cadence possible, you are training the \u0027on/off\u0027 switch in each muscle group to not only work faster but to have less overlap with your other muscle groups.

While the first few efforts in each set will feel \u0022easy,\u0022 since these blocks are stretched out to 8-minutes in length, you will be deep into the red by the end of each set.\n\nWhile the efforts aren\u0027t continuous, they are long enough that you will accumulate plenty of time near your VO2max, which is the goal of any MAP workout. The real kicker from this session is how much time you spend at 100% of MAP. Each 8-minute set gives you 5 minutes and 20-seconds of time at your 5-minute peak power. By the end, you are looking at 16 minutes of accumulated MAP efforts, so expect this one to bring some pain!\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n1 minute 30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute 15 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 4 -- 70% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 150% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n1 minute 30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of sets: 3\n\nRest between sets: 5 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nInterval repeats per set: 8\n\n\u200B\n\n**Interval**\n\nWork: 40 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\nRest: 20 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n3 minutes 45 seconds @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR \u003C70%\n",

A small country in the Balkan Peninsula that hides some of the most beautiful natural wonders and unique cultural heritage in this part of the world. Yet it remains unknown to many. Only the alternative, curious and brave plan their journeys in this hidden gem. However, a small self-organized crew from Serbia and Germany set a mission to discover and reveal those stunning natural creations of Serbia. On a bicycle. In just five days, they traversed 450 kilometers across six mountains of Western Serbia, and climbed around 11,000 meters to film and produce what you are about to experience.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: The workout accompanying this film is a recovery session. It\u0027s a very low-intensity ride, with your power remaining at or below 50% of FTP (an RPE less than 2.5 on a scale from 1 to 10) and your heart rate in Zone 1. The intensity and cadence targets will vary throughout this session to keep it interesting, but not so much that it distracts you from the story.\n",

Just like cadence builds, this session becomes one of the best ways to train your neuromuscular system.\n\nEven if your target event does not require you to complete maximal sprints, there is a substantial trickle-down efficiency effect to the longer-duration power efforts when you train your neuromuscular system.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/9866624296)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

              "description": "In this session, you will be going straight from a max 20-second high torque starting effort into 40 seconds right at MAP. The Starting effort should just about completely drain your Anaerobic Capacity, which will leave you gasping for air as you start each 40-second MAP effort. By forcing yourself to maintain MAP after a maximal sprint, you are asking your body to increase oxygen supply to your muscles as quickly as possible by increasing your heart rate and breathing rate. Being able to increase oxygen consumption rapidly means your body will better handle changes in pace both above and below threshold.\n\n\u200B\n\nWhat you need to do:\n\n- You will need to begin each Standing Start at super low RPM\u0027s with very high torque (high resistance). To maximize muscle recruitment you want to both push-down and pull-up on the pedals at the start. Proper core engagement is a must, as your legs need a sturdy backboard to push against.\n- You\u0027ll want the starting resistance to be just high enough that only your max effort can get the pedals moving; after those first few revs your goal is to get your cadence up as high as possible by the end of the 20 seconds. The best way to ensure you have the right resistance is to complete this session in slope mode rather than ERG mode.\n- Once the 20-second start is over you want to settle right into the 40-second effort at MAP, avoiding any significant drop in power at the transition point. Since the goal of this 40-second MAP effort is maximal cardiovascular demand, aim to hold your cadence 10-15 RPM higher than you would for the 5-minute test in Full Frontal.\n\nFor Time Trialists and Triathletes:\n\nAfter the Standing Start, you will want to get into your aerobars and hold the same position you will be competing in. Those on regular road bikes should get down into the drops.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n15 minute @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n3 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of sets: 5\n\nRest between sets: 15 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nInterval repeats per set: NA\n\n**Interval**\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 180% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n40 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 95-105%% of MAP (115-135% of FTP)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n8 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR \u003C70%\n",

The first two drills, Cadence Holds and Builds, are designed to improve the way you recruit your leg, glute and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke. They do this by forcing you to sustain a cadence just above \u0027comfortable\u0027 and by pushing you to your maximal cadence.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe last drill, Single Leg Efforts, ask you to unclip one leg and ride at a steady, single-legged effort. This forces you to pull up on the pedal instead of just pushing down and ensures maximal muscle awareness and engagement. This workout is best done while riding indoors on a trainer because even small variations in terrain can affect your ability to properly execute this workout. The majority of this workout is done in heart rate Z1/2 /// 50-75% of threshold /// RPE 2-5. You should keep the effort level below threshold (heart rate Z4, 100% of threshold, RPE 7-8) during the max cadence efforts.\n\n\u200B\n\nWORKOUT GOALS:\n\n- To improve stillness and stability at high cadences.\n- To improve muscle fiber engagement for improved efficiency at all cadences.\n- To increase maximum cadence.\n- To make that pedal stroke as smooth as butter.\n\nCADENCE TARGETS:\n\n- Warm-up 80-90rpm\n- Build: 90-150rpm\n- Hold: 115rpm\n- Single Leg: 85rpm\n\nListen to The Knowledge podcast, by Wahoo Sports Science - The Benefits of High Cadence Training: [https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence](https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n3 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 3\n\nRest Between Sets: 8 minutes @ RPE 23 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: N/A\n\n**Interval**\n\nCadence Build: 30 seconds @ RPE 8 -- Starting at 90RPM Build to Max RPM -- Max Power is NOT Goal\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nCadence Hold: 45 seconds @ RPE 7.5 -- \u003C100% FTP -- Highest RPM you can hold without Bouncing\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nSingle Leg: 1 minute @ RPE 6 -- Single Leg Only -- \u003C50% of FTP\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nSingle Leg: 1 minute @ RPE 6 -- Single Leg Only, Opposite Leg -- \u003C50% of FTP (100% of FTP with both legs = 50% of FTP\n\nwith one leg)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n8 minutes 15 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

              "description": "This skills session is designed to mimic a variety of challenging course conditions and scenarios you will encounter on race day. The skills practiced here are done below race pace so you can focus on proper execution. To properly complete this ride you will need to find a field with the following features and bring along some equipment:  \n  \nA set of stairs, ideally with enough area at the top to practice re-mounting your bike.  \nA flat, open area to practice Figure 8s. Use water bottles or cones to mark the corners.  \nA hill to practice off-camber riding.  \nBarriers about shin high, which can be made from PVC pipe or improvised using your imagination (and a few water bottles).  \n  \nHere\u2019s how to tackle this session:  \n  \nWarm-up for 10-15 minutes Z1/Z2 spinning, include 2 x 1 minute Z3 efforts to warm up.  \n  \nStairs. Complete 3-4 sets:  \nApproach the stairs at a decent speed (but don\u2019t go over a Z3 effort).  \nDismount and focus on the technique needed to maintain your momentum up the stairs. Experiment with both the timing of your dismount and how you hold your bike while running up the stairs. You may wish to sling it over your shoulder or pick it up by the top tube and handlebars.  \nAt the top remount as smoothly as possible while trying to maintain your forward momentum.  \n  \nFigure 8s. Complete 5-10 minutes:  \nFor more info on Figure 8s read \u201CTips for Figure 8s\u201D.  \nSet up two bottles or cones roughly 20m apart and practice your Figure 8s.  \nFocus on maintaining your speed, and try to avoid accelerating or surging out of the \u201Cturns\u201D.  \nIf you\u2019re feeling frisky you can break up the Figure 8s with 50-75m Field Runs every couple minutes.  \n  \nBarriers. Complete 4-8 sets:  \nNext, set up some barriers (you can make a portable set from PVC pipe, or you can use some water bottles and your imagination).  \nHit your barrer section at a decent speed (again trying to avoid going over Z3).  \nPractice and perfect the timing of your dismount and remount. The key here is keeping your leg speed quick and nimble between the barriers!  \n  \nOff-Camber Riding. Complete 5-10 minutes:  \nRide to the top of the hill and then ride along the length of the crest. Try to hold a straight line while not gaining or losing elevation.  \nTurn around and ride it in the opposite direction.  \nAs your off-camber skills develop you can try riding faster and faster to see where your limit is, and sometimes that means going over it! Be safe, but remember that you won\u2019t know what you can and can\u2019t do until you try!  \n  \nFinish with 5-10 minutes of easy spinning to cool down.  \n  \n**Warm-Up  \n**8 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%  \n1 minutes @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%  \n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%  \n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C 80%  \n4 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%  \n  \n**Main Effort  \n**Number of Sets: 4  \nRest Between Sets: 2 minutes  \nInterval Repeats per Set: 1  \n**Interval  \n**8 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70% focusing on assigned skill  \n2 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%  \n  \n**Extra Volume  \n**N/A  \n  \n**Cool Down  \n**5 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%  \n",

Focus on targeting your weaknesses during this trail session in order to improve them come race day.\n\n\u200B\n\n**How?**\n\nThis is an unstructured ride - let the trail do the thinking today. If you find a section that you struggle to hit cleanly, repeat that section a few times until you feel comfortable with it. Don\u2019t feel the need to practice every section you struggle with on a single ride, you can always come back another day! Keep the effort below 85% of FTP at all times and spend the bulk of the ride around 60% of FTP.\n\n\u200B\n\nMake sure to warm up well and cool down afterwards.\n",

This session is designed to sharpen muscle activation and improve recovery after intense efforts.\n\nFinish strong, and I\u2019ll see you in Burgberg!\n\n\u200B\n\nWith short near-maximal sprint efforts like these, you\u2019ll recruit all of the muscle fibers in your legs. While cadence builds force your muscles to contract and relax as quickly as possible, this session forces your muscles to contract with maximal power. Just like cadence builds, this session becomes one of the best ways to train your neuromuscular system.\n\nEven if your target event does not require you to complete maximal sprints, there is a substantial trickle-down efficiency effect to the longer-duration power efforts when you train your neuromuscular system.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/9866624296)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

While not an out-and-out sprinter, you\u2019re the fast man of the AG2R Citroen team. You don\u2019t have a leadout so you\u2019re on your own to grab a result. Do you have what it takes to go it alone and secure the win?\n\n\u200B\n\n**About ProRides**\n\nHere\u2019s your chance to experience what it\u2019s like to ride in the biggest races in the world, thanks to SYSTM\u2019s 4DP platform. We\u2019ve taken the first-person camera footage and power data from a pro cyclist and analyzed it to determine which part of their 4DP\u00AE profile each of their efforts corresponds to. But since few of us can put down pro-level watts, we made it so all of the efforts are scaled to your own personal 4DP\u00AE profile. That means you get to experience exactly what the pros experience relative to your own abilities. When they sprint, you sprint. When they attack, you attack. When they sit up, you get to take it (relatively) easy. It\u0027s the most immersive, realistic race simulation out there.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s some more information on how to create the most immersive ProRides experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterProRides)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Featured Footage: **Velon\n",

We\u2019ll be breaking this 10km climb down into three distinct sections, kicking off with a block of 6 x 50 second high tempo efforts with a 10 second burst out of the saddle before taking a swift breather before getting back on it. As we climb through the pine forest we\u2019ll switch things up a touch, alternating between low and high cadence for 30 seconds at a time for around 7 minutes. We\u2019ll then revert back to our 50 second high tempo with 10 second burst out of the saddle efforts before we build up our effort to the summit. This is going to be a challenging workout so make sure you\u2019re ready and whatever you do don\u2019t forget to take a moment to look at the views!!\n\n\u200B\n\nThis workout combines multiple different interval types that focus on improving threshold power via over-under style efforts along with low cadence work for your muscular endurance. The first and last climbs also fire up your whole energy systems with some sprints to the summit.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/8735613403)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

              "description": "_Standing Starts_ closely simulates a lifting session on the bike because it requires the engagement of your core, upper body, and lower body. It trains your ability to generate force through the pedals by ensuring you recruit ALL of your muscles to get those cranks turning. No matter your preferred discipline, these efforts are key to teaching your body to recruit all of the muscle fibers in your legs.\n\n\u200B\n\nAll of the benefits in this session come from hitting these 20-second efforts as hard as you possibly can. To do that, you need full recovery between each sprint, and you need to respect that recovery. These efforts should see you start at super low RPMs with very high torque. As you start and increase the effort, your cadence will naturally increase. **Your goal is to get your cadence as high as possible by the end of each 20-second effort.** To maximize your muscle recruitment, you want to both push down and pull up on the pedals at the start. Proper core engagement is a must - your legs need a good strong backboard to push against.\n\n\u200B\n\nWe understand that not everyone\u0027s trainer has the necessary resistance or the required stability to perform this workout as described. If you can\u0027t safely stand up, then you can get much of the same benefit by doing these efforts seated. If your trainer can\u2019t handle the rapid change in speed or does not have high enough resistance at a super low cadence, then you can start the efforts at a higher cadence and treat them as \u201Cnormal\u201D all-out sprints.\n",

              "description": "Tempo sessions are always a great time to work on pace control. We are taking that pacing demand a bit further in this session by forcing you to slightly increase your effort as time goes on. This is referred to as a \u0022Negative-Split\u0022, meaning the second half is faster (or you hold a higher power) than the first half.\n\n\u200B\n\nWhile you might question the benefit of doing \u0022easier\u0022 tempo efforts, the truth is when riding between 80% and 100% of FTP your body processes oxygen and metabolites at nearly the same rate. Holding a higher power will give you a higher single day training stimulus, but looking at the big picture that can have its drawbacks. Mainly the fatigue those harder sessions cause, which requires easier workouts the days before and after. Sticking to the Tempo targets gets you nearly the same training stimulus while allowing you to hit harder sessions the rest of the week.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session contains a single 30-minute tempo effort, broken into three 10-minute segments. You will spend the first 10-minutes at 80% of FTP, the next 10 at 84%, and the final 10 at 87%. By the time you hit the last 10-minutes of this effort, that 87% will feel much harder than it should. Another way of thinking about this one, if you were to reverse the order, and start at 87%, what you would likely find is that your RPE stays fairly consistent for the entire effort, even though the power targets are dropping.\n\n\u200B\n\nOverheating, not drinking enough, being under-fueled and mental fatigue will all play a factor in how you feel in that final block. They will also impact your heart rate. While these power targets are usually associated with Zone 3 heart rate, many people will see their heart rate climb into low Z4 if they are not hydrating properly, or have inadequate cooling. This can be a great session to act as a \u0022wake up call\u0022 on any poor training habits you might have, so take note and aim to address those issues during your next workout.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n30 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7 -- 90% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C95%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 8 -- 110% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: N/A\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 1\n\n**Interval**\n\nEffort 1: 10 minutes @ RPE 6 -- 80% of FTP-- HR \u003C85%\n\nEffort 2: 10 minutes @ RPE 6 -- 83% of FTP-- HR \u003C90%\n\nEffort 3: 10 minutes @ RPE 6 -- 87% of FTP-- HR \u003C95%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n1 hour 15 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C85%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- \u003C45% of FTP -- HR \u003C 70%\n",

              "description": "This skills session is designed to mimic a variety of challenging course conditions and scenarios you will encounter on race day. The skills practiced here are done below race pace so you can focus on proper execution. To properly complete this ride you will need to find a field with the following features and bring along some equipment:  \n  \nA set of stairs, ideally with enough area at the top to practice re-mounting your bike.  \nA flat, open area to practice Figure 8s. Use water bottles or cones to mark the corners.  \nA hill to practice off-camber riding.  \nBarriers about shin high, which can be made from PVC pipe or improvised using your imagination (and a few water bottles).  \n  \nHere\u2019s how to tackle this session:  \n  \nWarm-up for 10-15 minutes Z1/Z2 spinning, include 2 x 1 minute Z3 efforts to warm up.  \n  \nStairs. Complete 3-4 sets:  \nApproach the stairs at a decent speed (but don\u2019t go over a Z3 effort).  \nDismount and focus on the technique needed to maintain your momentum up the stairs. Experiment with both the timing of your dismount and how you hold your bike while running up the stairs. You may wish to sling it over your shoulder or pick it up by the top tube and handlebars.  \nAt the top remount as smoothly as possible while trying to maintain your forward momentum.  \n  \nFigure 8s. Complete 5-10 minutes:  \nFor more info on Figure 8s read \u201CTips for Figure 8s\u201D.  \nSet up two bottles or cones roughly 20m apart and practice your Figure 8s.  \nFocus on maintaining your speed, and try to avoid accelerating or surging out of the \u201Cturns\u201D.  \nIf you\u2019re feeling frisky you can break up the Figure 8s with 50-75m Field Runs every couple minutes.  \n  \nBarriers. Complete 4-8 sets:  \nNext, set up some barriers (you can make a portable set from PVC pipe, or you can use some water bottles and your imagination).  \nHit your barrer section at a decent speed (again trying to avoid going over Z3).  \nPractice and perfect the timing of your dismount and remount. The key here is keeping your leg speed quick and nimble between the barriers!  \n  \nOff-Camber Riding. Complete 5-10 minutes:  \nRide to the top of the hill and then ride along the length of the crest. Try to hold a straight line while not gaining or losing elevation.  \nTurn around and ride it in the opposite direction.  \nAs your off-camber skills develop you can try riding faster and faster to see where your limit is, and sometimes that means going over it! Be safe, but remember that you won\u2019t know what you can and can\u2019t do until you try!  \n  \nFinish with 5-10 minutes of easy spinning to cool down.  \n  \n**Warm-Up  \n**8 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%  \n1 minutes @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%  \n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%  \n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C 80%  \n4 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%  \n  \n**Main Effort  \n**Number of Sets: 4  \nRest Between Sets: 2 minutes  \nInterval Repeats per Set: 1  \n**Interval  \n**8 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70% focusing on assigned skill  \n2 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%  \n  \n**Extra Volume  \n**N/A  \n  \n**Cool Down  \n**5 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%  \n",

              "description": "**Half Monty: The Easy One.**\n\n\u200B\n\nWe recommend this fitness test for:\n\n- Newer riders\n- Athletes with limited experience pacing maximal efforts / fitness testing.\n- Those who are mid-plan or who just want to get a sense of where their fitness is.\n\nThe _Half Monty_ 4DP fitness test is the most accurate and complete ramp test available. While it\u0027s not as comprehensive or as accurate as our main fitness test, _Full Frontal_, it\u0027s far more approachable and easier to pace for new riders. It also doesn\u0027t require any special preparation. You just need to feel relatively fresh.\n\n\u200B\n\nBased on more than a year of research (and after dozens of lab tests and thousands of online tests) and using sophisticated analysis of power and heart rate data, _Half Monty_ is far more accurate and comprehensive than standard ramp tests.\n\n\u200B\n\nIt also tells you more about who you are as an athlete. _Half Monty_ provides you with your FTP, Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP), and Cycling Threshold Heart Rate (cTHR), all of which we use to personalize your workout targets.\n\n\u200B\n\nIf you\u0027re still using the 4DP estimates when you set up your account, _Half Monty_ will also refine your AC and NM estimates (but will not do so if you\u0027ve done _Full Frontal_ or manually adjusted your estimates). If you want fully accurate AC and NM, as well as your Rider Type, Strengths, Weaknesses, and training plans adjusted to those Strengths and Weaknesses, you\u0027ll need to expose yourself to the _Full Frontal_ 4DP fitness test.\n\n\u200B\n\nReady to climb the ramp? You\u0027ll need the following before you start:\n\n- A heart rate monitor if you want the most accurate results. Don\u0027t have one? Order one [HERE](https://wahoofitness.com/devices)\n- Some kind of power device connected (trainer, power meter, virtual power, etc.)\n- Be ready to pay close attention to the instructions in the workout\n- Be sure your profile is complete and up-to-date (Profile \u003E About You). Accurate information helps us make our calculations\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to \u0027[Why Fitness Testing Matters](https://the-knowledge-by-wahoo-sports-science.simplecast.com/episodes/testing-testing-1-2-3-why-fitness-testing-matters)\u0027 on The Knowledge Podcast by Wahoo Sports Science.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s some more information on how to get the most from your fitness test.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterFitnessAssessment)\n",

              "description": "The goal of this workout is to help develop your baseline aerobic fitness. While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high and your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week. Shorter Endurance rides (like this one) can fit in both a hard week of training and a recovery week. That is, only if you do it right! Most people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022\n\n\u200B\n\nTruth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride, especially one under 90 minutes should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted.\n\nSo what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like? For 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70%, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in low to mid Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can; for most this is 80-90rpm. Also, your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster, but you will have to trust us on this one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions, or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: 2\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nNA\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

              "description": "One of the best sessions for neuromuscular training, this drill asks you to progressively build from a cadence of 90 RPM to your MAX over 30 seconds, recover, and repeat several times. Cadence builds improve how you recruit your leg, gluteal, and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke by progressing to your maximal cadence. By reaching your highest cadence possible, you are training the \u0027on/off\u0027 switch in each muscle group to not only work faster but to have less overlap with your other muscle groups. This session trains your hamstring muscles to \u0027turn off\u0027 when your quads \u0027turn on\u0027 and vice-versa, resulting in a more efficient pedal stroke at both high and low cadences.\n\n\u200B\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to The Knowledge podcast, by Wahoo Sports Science - The Benefits of High Cadence Training: [https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence](https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence)\n",

              "description": "They say that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. And through the bleeding eyes of Sufferlandrians, what could possibly be more beautiful than the sharp, saw-tooth profile of the workout you see before you? Full of gorgeous, shapely, shimmering blocks of yellow Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) efforts interspersed with mercifully brief and slightly inadequate recoveries, it\u0027s a real stunner.\n\n\u200B\n\nBut you know what\u0027s even better looking than this alluring workout? You (after you\u0027ve completed the workout, that is). Originally designed by our Head of Sports Science, Neal Henderson, for his professional athletes, The Model is a beautiful portrait of MAP brutality. It\u0027s one of those sessions that you think you can\u0027t finish, but always somehow do. It will leave you breathless, feeling all tingly, a bit confused and lying in a blubbering heap. It\u0027s a look. It will also deliver a nice boost to your fitness that always looks and feels good.\n\n\u200B\n\nA true love letter to the beauty of professional cycling, The Model features a banging soundtrack and thrilling footage from both the men\u0027s and women\u0027s pelotons. With its eclectic design, effects, and graphics, you\u0027ll find yourself unable to tear your eyes away from the action on screen (assuming you can lift them from your stem).\n",

              "description": "Meandering along the scenic River Iller, it\u2019s time to break out your gravel bike for a classic cadence build and hold session. We\u2019ll kick off with 5 x 30-second cadence builds, allowing for 2 minutes of recovery between each, before moving on to 5 x 60-second cadence holds, again with 2 minutes recovery.\n\nWhile this session may be short, it\u2019s a key part of your weekly plan, designed to keep you efficient and in top form, even when the cadence ramps up. Stay smooth and steady\u2014and remember, \u201Cno bobbing!\u201D\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Builds:** The name of the game here is absolute peak cadence, not peak power. To achieve this, you need to be in a small gear and have very light resistance. Starting at 90-RPM, steadily increase your cadence until you reach your absolute max with about 5-seconds left, and hold that to the end. Your limiting factor on these efforts needs to be leg speed. If resistance/power output is your limiting factor, try starting in an easier gear, or shift into an easier gear 15-seconds in. Bouncing in the saddle is okay for this drill.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Holds**: These efforts require you to maintain the highest cadence you can without starting to bounce in the saddle. For some of you that will be 100-RPM, for others, it will be 150-RPM. The key is to settle into YOUR peak sustainable cadence. Like the Builds, the goal here is not high power, so these efforts are limited to 90% of FTP. Do not be surprised if your heart rate is well into Zone 4 by the time you hit the last few holds.\n\n\nTo properly execute this session, your effort between drills needs to be low. With limited recovery time between these maximal Neuromuscular Efforts, riding above Zone 1 between efforts will only reduce your ability to max out your cadence. While the power targets between are Zone 1, do not be surprised if your heart rate does not drop below Zone 2 after the first couple builds.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/9885886076)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty. As founder of The Col Collective, Mike has made a career out of riding, filming, and telling the story of epic rides and mountains across the continent. As your On Location co-creator and host, Mike\u0027s engaging character, curious mind, and friendly nature will have you cueing up your next ride with him before you\u0027ve even finished the cool-down._\n",

This one, however is a little less focused on Anaerobic Capacity and a little more on muscle endurance, due to that big blue block in the middle. The first pyramid will begin to fatigue your muscles and tax your AC before you face 20 minutes at tempo. With both of those efforts under your belt, the second pyramid will drain the rest of your AC and ask your aerobic system to pick up the slack. This might even feel similar to a mountain bike or cyclocross race effort- you take it out hard, jockeying for the hole shot or a front pack position before getting into the technical elements. Then you settle into a sustainable effort for a short while, maybe working with a couple others before battling it out for your final finishing position.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n9 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4 -- 70% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n**Build x3**\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n1 minute 30 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of sets: 2\n\nRest between sets: 20 minutes @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR \u003C100\n\nInterval repeats per set: 1\n\n**Interval **\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 200% of FTP -- \u003E105%\n\n50 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 9.5 -- 180% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n40 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 150% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n40 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n50 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n50 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n40 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 150% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 9.5 -- 180% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n40 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 200% of FTP -- \u003E105%\n\n7 minutes 30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume **\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down **\n\n10 minutes 40 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n",

              "description": "Meandering along the scenic River Iller, it\u2019s time to break out your gravel bike for a classic cadence build and hold session. We\u2019ll kick off with 5 x 30-second cadence builds, allowing for 2 minutes of recovery between each, before moving on to 5 x 60-second cadence holds, again with 2 minutes recovery.\n\nWhile this session may be short, it\u2019s a key part of your weekly plan, designed to keep you efficient and in top form, even when the cadence ramps up. Stay smooth and steady\u2014and remember, \u201Cno bobbing!\u201D\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Builds:** The name of the game here is absolute peak cadence, not peak power. To achieve this, you need to be in a small gear and have very light resistance. Starting at 90-RPM, steadily increase your cadence until you reach your absolute max with about 5-seconds left, and hold that to the end. Your limiting factor on these efforts needs to be leg speed. If resistance/power output is your limiting factor, try starting in an easier gear, or shift into an easier gear 15-seconds in. Bouncing in the saddle is okay for this drill.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Holds**: These efforts require you to maintain the highest cadence you can without starting to bounce in the saddle. For some of you that will be 100-RPM, for others, it will be 150-RPM. The key is to settle into YOUR peak sustainable cadence. Like the Builds, the goal here is not high power, so these efforts are limited to 90% of FTP. Do not be surprised if your heart rate is well into Zone 4 by the time you hit the last few holds.\n\n\nTo properly execute this session, your effort between drills needs to be low. With limited recovery time between these maximal Neuromuscular Efforts, riding above Zone 1 between efforts will only reduce your ability to max out your cadence. While the power targets between are Zone 1, do not be surprised if your heart rate does not drop below Zone 2 after the first couple builds.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/9885886076)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

              "description": "This skills session is designed to mimic a variety of challenging course conditions and scenarios you will encounter on race day. The skills practiced here are done below race pace so you can focus on proper execution. To properly complete this ride you will need to find a field with the following features and bring along some equipment:  \n  \nA set of stairs, ideally with enough area at the top to practice re-mounting your bike.  \nA flat, open area to practice Figure 8s. Use water bottles or cones to mark the corners.  \nA hill to practice off-camber riding.  \nBarriers about shin high, which can be made from PVC pipe or improvised using your imagination (and a few water bottles).  \n  \nHere\u2019s how to tackle this session:  \n  \nWarm-up for 10-15 minutes Z1/Z2 spinning, include 2 x 1 minute Z3 efforts to warm up.  \n  \nStairs. Complete 3-4 sets:  \nApproach the stairs at a decent speed (but don\u2019t go over a Z3 effort).  \nDismount and focus on the technique needed to maintain your momentum up the stairs. Experiment with both the timing of your dismount and how you hold your bike while running up the stairs. You may wish to sling it over your shoulder or pick it up by the top tube and handlebars.  \nAt the top remount as smoothly as possible while trying to maintain your forward momentum.  \n  \nFigure 8s. Complete 5-10 minutes:  \nFor more info on Figure 8s read \u201CTips for Figure 8s\u201D.  \nSet up two bottles or cones roughly 20m apart and practice your Figure 8s.  \nFocus on maintaining your speed, and try to avoid accelerating or surging out of the \u201Cturns\u201D.  \nIf you\u2019re feeling frisky you can break up the Figure 8s with 50-75m Field Runs every couple minutes.  \n  \nBarriers. Complete 4-8 sets:  \nNext, set up some barriers (you can make a portable set from PVC pipe, or you can use some water bottles and your imagination).  \nHit your barrer section at a decent speed (again trying to avoid going over Z3).  \nPractice and perfect the timing of your dismount and remount. The key here is keeping your leg speed quick and nimble between the barriers!  \n  \nOff-Camber Riding. Complete 5-10 minutes:  \nRide to the top of the hill and then ride along the length of the crest. Try to hold a straight line while not gaining or losing elevation.  \nTurn around and ride it in the opposite direction.  \nAs your off-camber skills develop you can try riding faster and faster to see where your limit is, and sometimes that means going over it! Be safe, but remember that you won\u2019t know what you can and can\u2019t do until you try!  \n  \nFinish with 5-10 minutes of easy spinning to cool down.  \n  \n**Warm-Up  \n**8 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%  \n1 minutes @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%  \n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%  \n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C 80%  \n4 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%  \n  \n**Main Effort  \n**Number of Sets: 4  \nRest Between Sets: 2 minutes  \nInterval Repeats per Set: 1  \n**Interval  \n**8 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70% focusing on assigned skill  \n2 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%  \n  \n**Extra Volume  \n**N/A  \n  \n**Cool Down  \n**5 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%  \n",

What is often missed in this project is that we truly believe in building a team, a family and more, that it would be even tougher to do alone. Sit down on your couch with some popcorn and a blanket, but don\u0027t forget to bring your friends - this one is full of moments that will make you want to get off the couch!\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: the workout accompanying this film varies from endurance to tempo to sub-threshold. The higher intensity efforts aren\u0027t the hardest you\u0027ll experience so that you can keep your attention on the film, however, they are just hard enough to help improve your FTP, oxygen utilization efficiency, and the ability to recover quickly between hard efforts. The workout intensity reflects the intensity of the riders in many places, so you may feel as if you\u0027re climbing Mont Ventoux or that you\u0027re a part of a sprint lead-out train on the run into the finish line.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s how to turn off on-screen graphics for the best viewing experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterInspiration)\n",

First, a variety of longer efforts build sustained power while also making sure you\u0027re sufficiently fatigued. This initial beatdown is necessary to ensure you get the maximum benefit from _Blender_\u0027s infamous \u0027Pain Shakes.\u0027 Three sets of these little devils help you develop a supernatural ability to recover from big efforts. The bonus is that you also beef up your ability to produce high-end power, building Anaerobic Capacity and Maximal Aerobic Power simultaneously.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe threshold efforts at the end are the bitter cherry on the sundae, improving your body\u0027s ability to produce aerobic power and helping make sure your FTP will get the same boost as your AC and MAP. A rising tide of lactic acid raises all boats. Oh, and clocking in at one hour and 40 minutes, Blender will also help whip your endurance into a frenzy.\n",

              "description": "In this session, you will be going straight from a max 20-second high torque starting effort into 40 seconds right at MAP. The Starting effort should just about completely drain your Anaerobic Capacity, which will leave you gasping for air as you start each 40-second MAP effort. By forcing yourself to maintain MAP after a maximal sprint, you are asking your body to increase oxygen supply to your muscles as quickly as possible by increasing your heart rate and breathing rate. Being able to increase oxygen consumption rapidly means your body will better handle changes in pace both above and below threshold.\n\n\u200B\n\nWhat you need to do:\n\n- You will need to begin each Standing Start at super low RPM\u0027s with very high torque (high resistance). To maximize muscle recruitment you want to both push-down and pull-up on the pedals at the start. Proper core engagement is a must, as your legs need a sturdy backboard to push against.\n- You\u0027ll want the starting resistance to be just high enough that only your max effort can get the pedals moving; after those first few revs your goal is to get your cadence up as high as possible by the end of the 20 seconds. The best way to ensure you have the right resistance is to complete this session in slope mode rather than ERG mode.\n- Once the 20-second start is over you want to settle right into the 40-second effort at MAP, avoiding any significant drop in power at the transition point. Since the goal of this 40-second MAP effort is maximal cardiovascular demand, aim to hold your cadence 10-15 RPM higher than you would for the 5-minute test in Full Frontal.\n\nFor Time Trialists and Triathletes:\n\nAfter the Standing Start, you will want to get into your aerobars and hold the same position you will be competing in. Those on regular road bikes should get down into the drops.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n15 minute @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n3 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of sets: 5\n\nRest between sets: 15 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nInterval repeats per set: NA\n\n**Interval**\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 180% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n40 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 95-105%% of MAP (115-135% of FTP)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n8 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR \u003C70%\n",

              "description": "This skills session is designed to mimic a variety of challenging course conditions and scenarios you will encounter on race day. The skills practiced here are done below race pace so you can focus on proper execution. To properly complete this ride you will need to find a field with the following features and bring along some equipment:  \n  \nA set of stairs, ideally with enough area at the top to practice re-mounting your bike.  \nA flat, open area to practice Figure 8s. Use water bottles or cones to mark the corners.  \nA hill to practice off-camber riding.  \nBarriers about shin high, which can be made from PVC pipe or improvised using your imagination (and a few water bottles).  \n  \nHere\u2019s how to tackle this session:  \n  \nWarm-up for 10-15 minutes Z1/Z2 spinning, include 2 x 1 minute Z3 efforts to warm up.  \n  \nStairs. Complete 3-4 sets:  \nApproach the stairs at a decent speed (but don\u2019t go over a Z3 effort).  \nDismount and focus on the technique needed to maintain your momentum up the stairs. Experiment with both the timing of your dismount and how you hold your bike while running up the stairs. You may wish to sling it over your shoulder or pick it up by the top tube and handlebars.  \nAt the top remount as smoothly as possible while trying to maintain your forward momentum.  \n  \nFigure 8s. Complete 5-10 minutes:  \nFor more info on Figure 8s read \u201CTips for Figure 8s\u201D.  \nSet up two bottles or cones roughly 20m apart and practice your Figure 8s.  \nFocus on maintaining your speed, and try to avoid accelerating or surging out of the \u201Cturns\u201D.  \nIf you\u2019re feeling frisky you can break up the Figure 8s with 50-75m Field Runs every couple minutes.  \n  \nBarriers. Complete 4-8 sets:  \nNext, set up some barriers (you can make a portable set from PVC pipe, or you can use some water bottles and your imagination).  \nHit your barrer section at a decent speed (again trying to avoid going over Z3).  \nPractice and perfect the timing of your dismount and remount. The key here is keeping your leg speed quick and nimble between the barriers!  \n  \nOff-Camber Riding. Complete 5-10 minutes:  \nRide to the top of the hill and then ride along the length of the crest. Try to hold a straight line while not gaining or losing elevation.  \nTurn around and ride it in the opposite direction.  \nAs your off-camber skills develop you can try riding faster and faster to see where your limit is, and sometimes that means going over it! Be safe, but remember that you won\u2019t know what you can and can\u2019t do until you try!  \n  \nFinish with 5-10 minutes of easy spinning to cool down.  \n  \n**Warm-Up  \n**8 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%  \n1 minutes @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%  \n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%  \n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C 80%  \n4 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%  \n  \n**Main Effort  \n**Number of Sets: 4  \nRest Between Sets: 2 minutes  \nInterval Repeats per Set: 1  \n**Interval  \n**8 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70% focusing on assigned skill  \n2 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%  \n  \n**Extra Volume  \n**N/A  \n  \n**Cool Down  \n**5 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%  \n",

In the mid 90\u0027s Professor Izumi Tabata set out to study the training impact of HIIT compared to a more traditional lower intensity high volume training. While both groups saw a similar increase in VO2max, only the HIIT group improved their Anaerobic Capacity, which is often associated with an increased ability to repeat hard efforts.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe HIIT protocol that Professor Izumi Tabata used 4-minute blocks broken into what we refer to as \u0022Micro-Intervals\u0022 20sec efforts well above VO2max Power (similar to what we refer to as MAP) and 10 seconds of recovery.\nThis was one of the first widely recognized studies that promoted HIIT, and since HIIT is The Sufferfest\u0027s Specialty, we would be crazy not to include this session, which rounds out our series of Micro-Interval workouts, which already includes 40/20\u0027s and 20/10\u0027s.\n\n\u200B\n\nDuring this session, you are looking at 3 sets of Micro-Intervals in 11-minute blocks, with each 30sec power target at or just below 100% of your MAP.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session really does pack a punch, and being mentally prepared for it is more important than being physically prepared. By design, this session will completely drain your AC and max out your aerobic system. No one gets to that point and feels \u0022good.\u0022 You need to mentally brace yourself to get into the hurt locker and stay down there until the bitter end.\n\n\u200B\n\nUncertain if you have that mental toughness or skill set to handle this session? Then check out the \u0022Getting Positive\u0022 module on our Mental Toughness Program.

              "description": "When it comes to \u0022peaking\u0022, or performing at your absolute best on a given day, the key is nailing your Taper. The term \u0022Taper\u0022 refers to how you train in the week or so before your target event to ensure you deliver your best performance. Generally, tapering means reducing your total training volume but continuing to hit some high-intensity efforts. While there are individual variations in the best way to taper, this session has been used by countless professionals leading into the biggest races of their lives -- athletes like World Champions Rohan Dennis and Flora Duffy.\n\n\u200B\n\nWith 3 sets of micro-intervals (40/20s, 30/30s, and 20/40s) you will hit your system with just enough intensity to keep your legs sharp and responsive, without adding any real fatigue. Outside of those 3 sets of micro-intervals, this session is purposefully short and easy. This is a preparation session, not a training session! After all, your event is just around the corner and all of the important training is behind you. Riding harder or longer today will do absolutely nothing to increase your fitness by event day; in fact, all that would do is increase your fatigue, which will only hurt your performance. Rather, this session makes sure your body is humming along and ready to perform on the big day.\n",

The first, male American to win the Tour de France, LeMond came back from the brink of death to beat his famed rivals in the historic and nail-biting race at the 1989 Tour de France.\n\nDirected by Alex Holmes and featuring exclusive interviews with LeMond and his wife Kathy as well as, never before seen footage, The Last Rider is an exhilarating portrait of one of the greatest athletes of our time.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: the workout accompanying this film varies from endurance to tempo to sub-threshold. The higher intensity efforts aren\u0027t the hardest you\u0027ll experience so that you can keep your attention on the film, however, they are just hard enough to help improve your FTP, oxygen utilization efficiency, and the ability to recover quickly between hard efforts. The workout intensity reflects the intensity of the riders in many places, so you may feel as if you\u0027re climbing Mont Ventoux or that you\u0027re a part of Cav\u0027s lead-out train on the run into the finish line.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s how to turn off on-screen graphics for the best viewing experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterInspiration)\n",

              "description": "This skills session is designed to develop skills for a variety of challenging course conditions and mimic scenarios you will encounter on race day. The skills practiced here are done at race pace so you can focus on proper execution while under pressure. To properly complete this ride you will need to find a field with the following features and bring along some equipment:  \n  \n- A set of stairs, ideally with enough area at the top to practice re-mounting your bike.  \n- A flat, open area to practice Figure 8s. Use water bottles or cones to mark the corners.  \n- A hill to practice off-camber riding.  \n- Barriers about shin high, which can be made from PVC pipe or improvised using your imagination (and a few water bottles).  \n- BONUS: an area with sand or deep and loose dirt.  \n  \nHere\u2019s how to tackle this session:  \n  \nWarm-up for 10-15 minutes Z1/Z2 spinning, include two 3-5 second hard accelerations.  \n  \nHole Shot \u002B Stairs. Complete 2 sets:  \nSimulate your race start by lining up 300-400m away from the stairs, in your starting gear and with one foot unclipped.  \nCountdown from 10 and you\u2019re OFF! Clip in and complete an all out 15 second effort.  \nWork on shifting up smoothly during the effort as you would in a race.  \nContinue the effort around Z3/Z4 effort for 60 seconds while riding towards the base of the stairs.  \nDismount and run up the stairs and remount at the top.  \nBetween the first and second set, do 50-100m of Field Running.  \n  \nBarriers. Complete 4-6 sets:  \nSet up some barriers (you can make a portable set from PVC pipe, or you can use some water bottles and your imagination).  \nStarting about 100m out from your barriers, speed towards the barriers at race pace.  \nThe challenge is to focus on the timing of your dismount and remount and to keep you leg speed high between the barriers in order to maintain the most momentum.  \n  \nFigure 8s. Complete 5-10 minutes:  \nFor more info on Figure 8s read \u201CTips for Figure 8s\u201D.  \nSet up 2 bottles about 30m apart and practice your Figure 8s.  \nTo simulate a race scenario, drive your first 3-4 pedal strokes super hard coming out of each \u201Cturn\u201D.  \nAlternate seated efforts and standing efforts and experiment with your gearing to find the best fit for your desired cadence and power.  \n  \nSand Pit. Complete 5-10 minutes:  \nIf you also have access to a sand pit then finish with 4-6 efforts through the sand. See \u201CTips For Sand\u201D to master this skill.  \nFinish with 5-10 minutes of easy spinning to cool down.  \n  \n**Warm-Up **8 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%  \n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%  \n1 minutes @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%  \n10 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 150% of FTP -- HR \u003C 100%  \n50 seconds @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C 70%  \n10 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 150% of FTP -- HR \u003C 100%  \n4 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%  \n  \n**Main Effort **  \nNumber of Sets: 4  \nRest Between Sets: 2 minutes  \nInterval Repeats per Set: 1  \n**Interval**  \n8 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70% focusing on assigned skill  \n2 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%  \n  \n**Extra volume **  \nN/A  \n  \n**Cool Down **  \n5 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%  \n",

If you find a section that you struggle to hit cleanly, repeat that section a few times until you feel comfortable with it. Don\u2019t feel the need to practice every section you struggle with on a single ride, you can always come back another day!
