              "description": "It\u2019s time for a wild coastal adventure with your host, Michael Cotty, across some of the stunning undulating roads of Galica, Spain. You\u2019ll start at a historic lighthouse on the \u2018Coast of Death\u2019 before working your way deep into the rugged landscape that defines this region. The road will guide your workout, with big efforts up every hill and a chance to take it a bit easier on the descents. It\u2019s not all hard work, though, Mike takes the time to show you around the fishing marina, where to find the \u2018hunger herb\u2019 and some of the sights around our finishing village, Muxia.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis is a great session for anyone who wants to get in a bit of sprint/anaerobic capacity efforts while laying down some solid aerobic time.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/7392408454)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty. As founder of The Col Collective, Mike has made a career out of riding, filming, and telling the story of epic rides and mountains across the continent. As your On Location co-creator and host, Mike\u0027s engaging character, curious mind, and friendly nature will have you cueing up your next ride with him before you\u0027ve even finished the cool-down._\n",

Nevertheless, you\u0027ve managed to recover and have rejoined the peloton and the GC favorites just at the base of the stage\u0027s major climb. Bridging the gap has taken its toll and you\u0027ll need to muster all of your strength and courage just to keep going. Can you defy the odds and not just finish with the pack but take the win? Be prepared for a big, long slog up Jebel Jais, the highest point in the UAE.\n\n\u200B\n\n**About ProRides**\n\nHere\u2019s your chance to experience what it\u2019s like to ride in the biggest races in the world, thanks to SYSTM\u2019s 4DP platform. We\u2019ve taken the first-person camera footage and power data from a pro cyclist and analyzed it to determine which part of their 4DP\u00AE profile each of their efforts corresponds to. But since few of us can put down pro-level watts, we made it so all of the efforts are scaled to your own personal 4DP\u00AE profile. That means you get to experience exactly what the pros experience relative to your own abilities. When they sprint, you sprint. When they attack, you attack. When they sit up, you get to take it (relatively) easy.

A Hammer race consist of three disciplines; the Hammer Climb, Sprint and Chase; all of which take place on a short circuit.\n\n\u200B\n\nYou\u0027re part of the Team CCC, taking part in the first day of racing at the Hammer Series: The Climb. It\u0027s a full-gas, two hours of racing where teams collect points on every lap at the top of the climb. Problem is, you\u0027re not a climber. You\u0027ll have to work and suffer as a team if you want to take top honors going into tomorrow\u0027s Sprint stage. Expect some elevated HR and sharp accelerations. Be prepared to leave it all out there on the road!\n\n\u200B\n\n**About ProRides**\n\nHere\u2019s your chance to experience what it\u2019s like to ride in the biggest races in the world, thanks to SYSTM\u2019s 4DP platform. We\u2019ve taken the first-person camera footage and power data from a pro cyclist and analyzed it to determine which part of their 4DP\u00AE profile each of their efforts corresponds to. But since few of us can put down pro-level watts, we made it so all of the efforts are scaled to your own personal 4DP\u00AE profile. That means you get to experience exactly what the pros experience relative to your own abilities. When they sprint, you sprint. When they attack, you attack. When they sit up, you get to take it (relatively) easy. It\u0027s the most immersive, realistic race simulation out there.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s some more information on how to create the most immersive ProRides experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterProRides)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Featured Footage: **Velon\n",
