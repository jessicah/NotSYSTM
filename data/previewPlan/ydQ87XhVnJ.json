Oh, and while 24 kilometers may not sound overly testing, we forgot to mention as well as the tempo we\u2019re going to be cranking the headwind up for this one.

As we depart the village of Mandelieu-la-Napoule and hug the Mediterranean coastline, we\u2019ll kick things off with a series of cadence pyramids. Although these in an of themselves may not feel overly taxing, as we head inland the fun really starts as Mike guides you through a series of threshold efforts with bursts on the striking red roads of l\u2019Est\u00E9rel, all the way to the summit of the Col Notre Dame. As we delve deeper into the many highlights of the area\u2014from the historic villages that line the coast to the ritz and glitz of Cannes\u2014we\u2019re definitely going to be working up a sweat here. Luckily, we\u0027ll be finishing up with a visit to the famous Galimard perfumery.
