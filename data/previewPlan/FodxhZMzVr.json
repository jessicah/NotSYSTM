      "description": "#### **Special Focus: Dynamic Level 3**\n\nThe six week Dynamic Focus plan is specifically designed to charge up your neuromuscular system, improve coordination, lateral stability and explosiveness to help you become a more efficient and resilient athlete. The three sessions each week will include integrated full body movements that require timing, coordination and strength as well as yoga sessions that will help you improve mobility and flexibility. As always, it is important to follow the progression with the Dynamic series in order to allow for adequate tissue adaptation.\n\n\u200B\n\nLevel 3 is for the athlete who recently completed Level 2 or coming back from a one to three month lay-off. This is also a good place for those transitioning from the gym to body weight workouts. As with any of the SYSTM strength plans, take your time with each session and follow the proper progression to reap the strength and mobility benefits.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis plan may be applied in conjunction with other Special Focused strength plans, such as Upper Body or Core Focus but is not recommended in conjunction with Lower Body Focus. If you choose to apply concurrent plans we suggest that you do so during the off-season or at a time when your endurance training volume is low.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe Special Focus stand alone plans follow a 2:1 progression and have three sessions per week on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.\n\n\u200B\n\nTime to hop to it!\n",

The session begins with a calming breathing technique, followed by a simple foot massage to introduce movement from the toes up to the heel. With increased range of motion, the routine progresses to gentle, dynamic stretches for the calves, hamstrings, and hips. Since feet are often neglected and subjected to high demands from activities like running or cycling, practicing this sequence at least once a week helps to rebalance and address this issue.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe objectives are to improve mobility in the feet and ankles, stretch the calves and hamstrings, and open up the hips.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Poses in this session:**\n\n- Easy Seat\n- Box Breathing\n- Foot Massage\n- Downward Dog\n- Screaming Toe\n- Yoga Squat\n- Ankle Stretch\n- Ankle Mobilisations\n- Windscreen Wipers\n",
