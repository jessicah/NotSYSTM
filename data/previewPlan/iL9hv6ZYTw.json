Our Full Body Strength series is exactly what you\u2019re after, offering a well-rounded series of exercises that covers the lower body, core, posterior chain, and upper body. With a substantial progression, there\u2019s enough here to keep you busy -- and improving -- for a very long time._\n\n\u200B\n\nYou\u2019re progressing quite nicely. So nicely, in fact, that you\u2019re ready for a more demanding session. This workout includes compound sets which are more difficult but, most importantly, more beneficial than simply doing more sets of a single move. This is because your nervous system has to work overtime to cope with the variety. The number of reps per set is also higher, which will help drive continuous improvement.\n\n\u200B\n\nSince this is a longer session, you may experience considerable fatigue on your first time through. As a result, pay more attention to your form. Your body will want to use as little energy as possible, which can lead to some bad habits when hitting rep after rep of a single move. Thankfully, the constant variation of the compound sets forces you to stay engaged and helps you keep solid form from start to finish.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?

To do this, we use a combination of isolated and integrated movements in a variety of body positions and build on the movements from Posterior Chain 1. We also introduce tempo movements that require extra focus on timing and eccentric loading. Even though this is only Level 2, you may find some of these moves difficult to perform.

We also introduce tempo movements that require extra focus on timing and eccentric loading. Even though this is only Level 2, you may find some of these moves difficult to perform.

It is vital in maintaining optimal posture during cycling and running in addition to water position in swimming. In this first session, we introduce some basic movements that focus on the activation and stabilization of posterior chain muscles. These moves include a combination of eccentric (lengthening), concentric (shortening), and isometric (holding) contractions. They provide your body with the foundation for more demanding moves to come.

This keeps your body adapted while allowing it to fully recover. To make the most out of your strength gains, you need to balance the hard work with adequate recovery. Given how short this session is, we strongly recommend completing a supplementary Yoga Session after this video. Something like Improving Posture, Shake Off the Day or Recovery Booster would be perfect.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Exercises Included**\n\n- Kneeling Hip Drive with Hands Over Head\n- Kneeling Hip Drive with Hips Side to Side\n- High Plank to Pigeon Pose\n- Plank with Leg Lifts\n- Hip Bridge with Reps\n- Fast Lateral Lunges with Knees Up\n- Standing Hip Drive with Hands Up\n- Standing Hip Drive with Hands Side to Side\n",
