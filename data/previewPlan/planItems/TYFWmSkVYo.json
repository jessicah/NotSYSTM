          "description": "Meandering along the scenic River Iller, it\u2019s time to break out your gravel bike for a classic cadence build and hold session. We\u2019ll kick off with 5 x 30-second cadence builds, allowing for 2 minutes of recovery between each, before moving on to 5 x 60-second cadence holds, again with 2 minutes recovery.\n\nWhile this session may be short, it\u2019s a key part of your weekly plan, designed to keep you efficient and in top form, even when the cadence ramps up. Stay smooth and steady\u2014and remember, \u201Cno bobbing!\u201D\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Builds:** The name of the game here is absolute peak cadence, not peak power. To achieve this, you need to be in a small gear and have very light resistance. Starting at 90-RPM, steadily increase your cadence until you reach your absolute max with about 5-seconds left, and hold that to the end. Your limiting factor on these efforts needs to be leg speed. If resistance/power output is your limiting factor, try starting in an easier gear, or shift into an easier gear 15-seconds in. Bouncing in the saddle is okay for this drill.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Holds**: These efforts require you to maintain the highest cadence you can without starting to bounce in the saddle. For some of you that will be 100-RPM, for others, it will be 150-RPM. The key is to settle into YOUR peak sustainable cadence. Like the Builds, the goal here is not high power, so these efforts are limited to 90% of FTP. Do not be surprised if your heart rate is well into Zone 4 by the time you hit the last few holds.\n\n\nTo properly execute this session, your effort between drills needs to be low. With limited recovery time between these maximal Neuromuscular Efforts, riding above Zone 1 between efforts will only reduce your ability to max out your cadence. While the power targets between are Zone 1, do not be surprised if your heart rate does not drop below Zone 2 after the first couple builds.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/9885886076)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty. As founder of The Col Collective, Mike has made a career out of riding, filming, and telling the story of epic rides and mountains across the continent. As your On Location co-creator and host, Mike\u0027s engaging character, curious mind, and friendly nature will have you cueing up your next ride with him before you\u0027ve even finished the cool-down._\n",

Nevertheless, you\u0027ve managed to recover and have rejoined the peloton and the GC favorites just at the base of the stage\u0027s major climb. Bridging the gap has taken its toll and you\u0027ll need to muster all of your strength and courage just to keep going. Can you defy the odds and not just finish with the pack but take the win? Be prepared for a big, long slog up Jebel Jais, the highest point in the UAE.\n\n\u200B\n\n**About ProRides**\n\nHere\u2019s your chance to experience what it\u2019s like to ride in the biggest races in the world, thanks to SYSTM\u2019s 4DP platform. We\u2019ve taken the first-person camera footage and power data from a pro cyclist and analyzed it to determine which part of their 4DP\u00AE profile each of their efforts corresponds to. But since few of us can put down pro-level watts, we made it so all of the efforts are scaled to your own personal 4DP\u00AE profile. That means you get to experience exactly what the pros experience relative to your own abilities. When they sprint, you sprint. When they attack, you attack. When they sit up, you get to take it (relatively) easy. It\u0027s the most immersive, realistic race simulation out there.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s some more information on how to create the most immersive ProRides experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterProRides)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Featured Footage: **Velon\n",

          "description": "Tempo sessions are always a great time to work on pace control, especially Tempo efforts longer than 30 minutes. We are taking that pacing demand a bit further in this session by forcing you to slightly increase your effort as time goes on. This is referred to as a \u0022Negative-Split\u0022, meaning the second half is faster (or you hold a higher power) than the first half.\n\n\u200B\n\nWhile you might question the benefit of doing \u0022easier\u0022 tempo efforts, the truth is when riding between 80% and 100% of FTP your body processes oxygen and metabolites at nearly the same rate. Holding a higher power will give you a higher single day training stimulus, but looking at the big picture that can have its drawbacks. Mainly the fatigue those harder sessions cause, which requires easier workouts the days before and after. Sticking to the Tempo targets gets you nearly the same training stimulus while allowing you to hit harder sessions the rest of the week.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session contains a single 60-minute tempo effort, broken into three 20-minute segments. You will spend the first 20-minutes at 80% of FTP, the next 20 at 84%, and the final 20 at 87%. By the time you hit the last 10-minutes of this effort, that 87% will feel much harder than it should. Another way of thinking about this one, if you were to reverse the order, and start at 87%, what you would likely find is that your RPE stays fairly consistent for the entire effort, even though the power targets are dropping.\n\n\u200B\n\nOverheating, not drinking enough, being under-fueled and mental fatigue will all play a factor in how you feel in that final block. They will also impact your heart rate. While these power targets are usually associated with Zone 3 heart rate, many people will see their heart rate climb into low Z4 if they are not hydrating properly, or have inadequate cooling. This can be a great session to act as a \u0022wake up call\u0022 on any poor training habits you might have so take note and aim to address those issues during your next workout.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n30 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 8 -- 105% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of sets: NA\n\nRest between sets: NA\n\nInterval repeats per: NA\n\n**Interval**\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 6 -- 80% of FTP -- HR \u003C100\n\n20 minutes@ RPE 6.5 -- 84% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 7 -- 87% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n45 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

          "description": "This is a session that you\u0027ll want to complete in Level, rather than Erg, mode. The only time we would suggest Erg mode is if you are unable to maintain the lower power targets set between sprints.\n\nWith short maximal sprint efforts, you\u0027ll recruit every muscle fiber you have in your legs each effort. While cadence builds force your muscles to contract and relax as quickly as possible, this session forces your muscles to contract with maximal force. Just like cadence builds this session becomes one of the best ways to train your neuromuscular system. Even if your target event does not require you to complete maximal sprints, there is a substantial trickle-down effect to the longer duration power efforts when you train your neuromuscular system.\n\nThis session is a great alternate to cadence builds or standing starts for those completing our SUF Strength sessions. On days you complete off the bike strength work you want your on-bike training to complement the suffering you put yourself through off the bike. That means short maximal efforts (whether for power or for cadence) are the best workouts to complement the strength gains you\u0027ve made off the bike.\n\nAs long as you run this session in slope mode you can complete the sprints either seated or out of the saddle. For those competing in events that do not require much (if any) standing (such as Time Trials or Triathlons) you should complete these sprints seated (and in the aero bars or drops if that is where you are racing).\n\nYou should also do these efforts seated if you don\u0027t feel an out-of-the-saddle maximal sprint is stable/safe to do on your trainer. Regardless of using ERG or Slope mode, you do not want to hold anything back on any sprint. Seeing your peak power drop as the session goes on is totally normal as your legs fatigue. This is where RPE really becomes the most important metric, rather than power, heart rate, or cadence.\n\nNow get on that bike and CRUSH IT!\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets\n\n1\n\nRest Between Sets:\n\nN/A\n\nInterval Repeats per Set:\n\n15\n\n**Interval:**\n\nSprint 10 seconds @ RPE 10 -- MAX SPRINT\n\n**Recovery:**\n\n9 minutes 50 seconds @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

While the first few efforts in each set will feel \u0022easy,\u0022 since these blocks are stretched out to 8-minutes in length, you will be deep into the red by the end of each set.\n\nWhile the efforts aren\u0027t continuous, they are long enough that you will accumulate plenty of time near your VO2max, which is the goal of any MAP workout. The real kicker from this session is how much time you spend at 100% of MAP. Each 8-minute set gives you 5 minutes and 20-seconds of time at your 5-minute peak power. By the end, you are looking at 16 minutes of accumulated MAP efforts, so expect this one to bring some pain!\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n1 minute 30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute 15 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 4 -- 70% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 150% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n1 minute 30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of sets: 3\n\nRest between sets: 5 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nInterval repeats per set: 8\n\n\u200B\n\n**Interval**\n\nWork: 40 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\nRest: 20 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n3 minutes 45 seconds @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR \u003C70%\n",

Even for an hour? Well, now\u0027s your chance. _Getting Away With It_ gets you out of the office and onto the roads of the French Pyrenees with your guide Michael Cotty of The Col Collective.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis is a great session to add toward the end of a training block. The shorter duration, sub-threshold efforts are fantastic for getting some extra FTP building while you are in a fatigued state. Extra emphasis on cadence stresses your nervous system, making your body more efficient at higher and lower RPMs while improving your form. The Neuromuscular training you get from this session is fantastic, so while your power never exceeds threshold, your body will learn to bring more energy to the pedals at all intensities.\n",

We\u2019ll be breaking this 10km climb down into three distinct sections, kicking off with a block of 6 x 50 second high tempo efforts with a 10 second burst out of the saddle before taking a swift breather before getting back on it. As we climb through the pine forest we\u2019ll switch things up a touch, alternating between low and high cadence for 30 seconds at a time for around 7 minutes. We\u2019ll then revert back to our 50 second high tempo with 10 second burst out of the saddle efforts before we build up our effort to the summit. This is going to be a challenging workout so make sure you\u2019re ready and whatever you do don\u2019t forget to take a moment to look at the views!!\n\n\u200B\n\nThis workout combines multiple different interval types that focus on improving threshold power via over-under style efforts along with low cadence work for your muscular endurance.

That means your heart rate and breathing rate will both be near their max by the end of each interval, especially in the final few intervals.\n\n\u200B\n\nSince it takes time for your heart rate and breathing rate to match your effort, for the first part of each interval, you will be tapping into your Anaerobic Capacity to produce the required power. To account for this, we have limited the recovery duration to be equal to the interval duration.

This session is similar to The Trick, with a few differences. On the plus side, all of the efforts are 15-seconds shorter than those in The Trick. To make up for this, we added two more intervals to this session, bringing the total to 6. That means by the end of this session you will have plowed through 4.5-minutes of AC work.\n\nThis workout is one of the few sessions that we do NOT recommend you complete in ERG mode if you are on a smart trainer. The goal is to hold onto the highest power you can for the full 45-seconds. Inevitably in the later sets, your power will dip before you reach the end of the interval. What we want is for you to complete every effort having given everything for 45-seconds. We don\u0027t want ERG mode grinding you to a halt because you cannot maintain the (ridiculously) high power targets. Even if you drop down below FTP in the final 10-seconds of these efforts, as long as you are going flat out, you are doing it correctly.\n\nJust take this session one interval at a time, and focus on giving your all for this one effort. You can worry about the others when you get to them.

We\u2019ve taken the first-person camera footage and power data from a pro cyclist and analyzed it to determine which part of their 4DP\u00AE profile each of their efforts corresponds to. But since few of us can put down pro-level watts, we made it so all of the efforts are scaled to your own personal 4DP\u00AE profile. That means you get to experience exactly what the pros experience relative to your own abilities. When they sprint, you sprint. When they attack, you attack. When they sit up, you get to take it (relatively) easy.

          "description": "In this workout, the shorter the interval duration, the higher the power target will be. Starting from 20 minutes of low Tempo, and finishing with 4-minutes of high-quality MAP work, proper pacing is crucial to success in this workout. While you could easily be above target power for the entire 20-minute effort, that would set you up to fail in the last two efforts. Be smart and pace yourself; you can always go harder in the final 5-minute effort if you want to!\n\n\nAt any intensity above Endurance pace, the longer you ride, the more fatigued you become. Completing the final 5-minute target when fresh would be unpleasant, hitting it after all of these other intervals makes it a near maximal effort. Proper hydration/cooling and nutrition are vital if you want to nail this workout.\n\n\nIf you are preparing for any longer ride/event where you will be required to keep on the gas from start to finish, this is the perfect session for you. Completing these efforts in this order not only gives a great physical training boost but also toughens you up mentally. Digging deep when fatigued is the key to good performance over longer distances, so expect to suffer in that final 5-minute effort; it will pay off both mentally and physically!\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up **\n\n30 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 4, all unique\n\nRest Between Sets: 12 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: N/A\n\n**Set 1** (20-minute Effort)\n\nSteady: 20 minutes @ RPE 7 -- 85% of FTP-- HR \u003C95%\n\n**Set 2** x4(16-minute Effort) \n\nSteady: 3 minutes @ RPE 7.25 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\nSurge: 1 minute @ RPE 7.75 -- 105% of FTP-- HR \u003C105%\n\n**Set 3 **(8-minute Effort)\n\nSurge: 1 minute @ RPE 8 -- 90% of MAP (105-125% of FTP)\n\nSteady: 6 minutes @ RPE 7.25 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\nSurge: 1 minute @ RPE 9 -- 95% of MAP (110-135% of FTP)\n\n**Set 4 **(4-minute Effort)\n\nEffort 1: 1 minute @ RPE 8 -- 90% of MAP (105-125% of FTP)\n\nEffort 2: 1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP\n\nEffort 3: 1 minute @ RPE 8 -- 90% of MAP (105-125% of FTP)\n\nEffort 4: 1 minute @ RPE 9.5 -- 100\u002B% of MAP (120-150% of FTP)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume **\n\n55 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C85%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down **\n\n6 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- \u003C45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n",

          "description": "If you want a do-it-all session that will maintain and improve nearly every aspect of your fitness, _The Chores_ is just the ticket. This workout features 3 sets of intervals. Each set combines a series of 40-second efforts with 20-second recoveries, followed by an immediate transition to a sustained effort just below threshold. These short efforts with minimal recovery deplete your anaerobic gas tank, forcing your body to get better at producing power aerobically. This combination will help improve your Anaerobic Capacity, (AC) your Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP), and your Functional Threshold Power (FTP), all in just under an hour.\n\n\u200B\n\nAt the start of each set, your body starts to dip into your anaerobic reserves to help hit the high-power targets. Your body then starts to ramp up your oxygen intake in order to produce more of the power requirements aerobically. With such short recovery time between these efforts, your AC is steadily drained through each set. By the time the last short interval arrives, your body will be forced to produce almost all of that power aerobically, which will push your lungs to their very limit.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis is the optimal time to stress your body\u2019s ability to produce power at threshold. With your AC depleted (and your lungs and heart working near maximal capacity), the shorter sustained efforts that would normally be a piece of cake will have a bit more...sting. No matter what your preferred discipline, terrain, or distance, this session will make you fitter and faster.\n\n\u200B\n\nFeaturing exciting, on-bike camera footage from the Velon Hammer Series, _The Chores_ will make you earn your keep.\n",

This is the typical intensity range that most group rides fall into- not a leisurely pace, but not so fast that people are falling off the back within minutes.

While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are just times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right!\n\n\u200B\n\nMost people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022 Truth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted. So what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like?\n\nFor 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70% is ok, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm and your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster. You will have to trust us on that one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions!

Cadence builds improve how you recruit your leg, gluteal, and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke by progressing to your maximal cadence. By reaching your highest cadence possible, you are training the \u0027on/off\u0027 switch in each muscle group to not only work faster but to have less overlap with your other muscle groups.

Generally, tapering means reducing your total training volume but continuing to hit some high-intensity efforts. While there are individual variations in the best way to taper, this session has been used by countless professionals leading into the biggest races of their lives -- athletes like World Champions Rohan Dennis and Flora Duffy.\n\n\u200B\n\nWith 3 sets of micro-intervals (40/20s, 30/30s, and 20/40s) you will hit your system with just enough intensity to keep your legs sharp and responsive, without adding any real fatigue. Outside of those 3 sets of micro-intervals, this session is purposefully short and easy. This is a preparation session, not a training session! After all, your event is just around the corner and all of the important training is behind you. Riding harder or longer today will do absolutely nothing to increase your fitness by event day; in fact, all that would do is increase your fatigue, which will only hurt your performance. Rather, this session makes sure your body is humming along and ready to perform on the big day.\n",

Unlike other SYSTM sessions, this one should not be viewed as a stand-alone \u201Ctraining\u201D session, but rather, the ace up your sleeve you pull out when that big ride comes around. The key to this session is having you spend just enough time right around threshold, with sufficient recovery between efforts and a handful of sprints to prime all of your systems for tomorrow\u0027s event.  \n",
