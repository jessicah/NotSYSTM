As you learn all about the local lavender, craft beer, how to make nougat, and why there are all those holes in the ground, Mike will take you through a series of sub-threshold cadence changes and big sprints before cooling down on the run-in to Monieux.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/3930255146)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty. As founder of The Col Collective, Mike has made a career out of riding, filming, and telling the story of epic rides and mountains across the continent. As your On Location co-creator and host, Mike\u0027s engaging character, curious mind, and friendly nature will have you cueing up your next ride with him before you\u0027ve even finished the cool-down._\n",
