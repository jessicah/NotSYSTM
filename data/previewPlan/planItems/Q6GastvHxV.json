  "description": "Welcome to the Mobility and Stability Series.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe workouts in this plan have been customized to match your Mobility Assessment. Each session is designed to enhance joint mobility and stability as well as improve circulation and muscular activation. The sessions are divided into five areas of focus; Cervical, Shoulder \u0026 Thoracic Spine, Low Back \u0026 Hamstring, Hip and pelvis, and Foot \u0026 Ankle.\n\n\u200B\n\nYou may have more than one session per day, but not to worry, the sessions are short and will not cause any residual fatigue. If you have an additional strength session or ride on your calendar we recommend doing your mobility session first.\n\n\u200B\n\nThese routines are NOT meant to be progressive. Rather, each will encourage a slightly different way of improving mobility in the targeted area.\n\n\u200B\n\nPlease take your time as you work through the sessions and remember that you should never move into or push through pain. Go at your own pace and feel free to repeat any of the moves.\n",
