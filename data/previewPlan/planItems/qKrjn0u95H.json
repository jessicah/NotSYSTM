As a National Champion on the track himself, and having coached countless track athletes, Neal\u0027s happy to introduce you to the boards with a series of challenges. You\u0027ll start with a little paceline work to ease into things (yes, you\u0027ll have to take your pulls). It gets more difficult from there, as you\u0027ll need to try to lap the group before hitching a ride with a multiple National and World Champion. You\u0027ll finish it off, of course, with a massive Kilometer effort.\n\n\u200B\n\nIn between, you\u0027ll learn a bit more about how Neal spends his recovery time, from gardening to family walks to time spent in his very own chill-out room.\n\n\u200B\n\n**When to ride: Do this on day 5 of the 7-day plan.**\n\n\u200B\n\n_About: Neal Henderson is one of the most accomplished coaches in cycling and multi-sport. His athletes have won more than 50 World Championships, set numerous world and national records, captured Olympic medals, worn leaders jerseys, and won stages in races like the Tour de France.
