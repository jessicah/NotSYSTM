Originally created in Coach Sir Neal Henderson\u0027s Penn State dorm room in 1992, it\u0027s his weapon of choice for bringing the pain (shakes).\n\n\u200B\n\nWhat\u0027s in the Blender? First, a variety of longer efforts build sustained power while also making sure you\u0027re sufficiently fatigued. This initial beatdown is necessary to ensure you get the maximum benefit from _Blender_\u0027s infamous \u0027Pain Shakes.\u0027 Three sets of these little devils help you develop a supernatural ability to recover from big efforts. The bonus is that you also beef up your ability to produce high-end power, building Anaerobic Capacity and Maximal Aerobic Power simultaneously.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe threshold efforts at the end are the bitter cherry on the sundae, improving your body\u0027s ability to produce aerobic power and helping make sure your FTP will get the same boost as your AC and MAP. A rising tide of lactic acid raises all boats. Oh, and clocking in at one hour and 40 minutes, Blender will also help whip your endurance into a frenzy.\n",

Cash Register is an adaptation of that idea and comes in the format of a sprint/settle/surge session consisting of 4 intervals that get a little shorter (but not easier) each round.\n\n\u200B\n\nEach interval kicks off with a sprint effort that targets your Neuromuscular (NM) power. Then you settle into a controlled, below-FTP effort that will accelerate the rate at which you can clear lactate from your muscles. You\u0027ll finish each effort off with a big surge based on your Anaerobic Capacity (AC). In just 30 minutes, you\u0027ll be doing efforts targeting your sprint power, FTP, and AC for an exceptionally well-rounded workout.\n\n\u200B\n\nSupport the Wahooligan Tour by [donating to the Davis Phinney Foundation](https://secure2.convio.net/dpf/site/TR?pg=pfind\u0026fr_id=1391) and their programs to help people living with Parkinsons.\n",

SUF).\n\nSet in a part of Sufferlandria renowned for its flat and straight roads that can wreak havoc on your soul, this session is, however, not quite as intense as its older brother The Long Scream, although it is a little bit longer for the sustained effort part.\n\n\u200B\n\n**What is it good for?**\n\nThis is a fantastic session to help you get ready for a Time Trial or long climb. It\u0027s also a super session for practicing your MTP Focus skills.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Pro tip**\n\n- Complete the \u0022_**09. Focus Exercise**_\u0022 from the Mental Training Program prior to riding this session. At just five minutes long, it\u0027s a great tool to improve your ability to push away distractions and focus on the task at hand in this mentally demanding session.\n- Fire the 3-minute \u0022_**Breathing to Crush Them**_\u0022 session from our Yoga library to be even better prepared and give your lungs extra space to suck in all that O2.\n",
