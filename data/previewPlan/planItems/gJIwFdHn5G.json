This includes everything from your powerful glutes, hamstrings, and calves to the postural muscles of your upper back and neck._\n\n\u200B\n\nThe second session in this series focuses on activating and strengthening key structural stability muscles and developing optimal tension throughout the body. To do this, we use a combination of isolated and integrated movements in a variety of body positions and build on the movements from Posterior Chain 1. We also introduce tempo movements that require extra focus on timing and eccentric loading. Even though this is only Level 2, you may find some of these moves difficult to perform. That\u0027s ok, take your time and focus on performing the moves correctly even if you have to pause the video.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?

Many of the exercises will be familiar from Level 1, but you\u2019ll likely find it a bit more challenging. That\u2019s because we\u2019ve made the durations a bit longer and the moves a little more complex.
