You\u2019re not right and are in desperate need of help.\n- You must be at least 18 years old.\n- You must have an active subscription to Wahoo X in order to be officially recognized as a Knight of Sufferlandria\u00AE.\n- You must do 10 eligible Sufferfest videos, back-to-back. Please check the list of eligible Sufferfest videos [here](https://support.wahoofitness.com/hc/en-us/articles/4406074947090-How-to-become-a-Knight-of-Sufferlandria)\n- You can do the videos in any order you like.\n- You may not do any video title more than once (e.g., you can\u0027t do the old and the remastered version of a video.\n- All workouts must be completed in the SYSTM app. Workouts completed outdoors using a Wahoo computer will not be applicable to a Knighthood Quest.\n- You are allowed 10 minutes rest between videos. No more. But less is fine.\n- We do not set any kind of performance benchmark for your ride (i.e., how hard you have to go). However, we insist that you do a ride in which you Suffer and which, most importantly, of which you are immensely proud of yourself for having given all you can give and a bit more.\n- We strongly encourage you to raise money for a good cause. It\u0027ll do good for the world, make you even prouder of yourself and rightly earn the praise of your fellow Sufferlandrians.\n\n**Upon completion, fill out this **[form](https://wahoosystm.com/kosapp)[**.**](https://thesufferfest.typeform.com/to/JtS2Df)** **(don\u2019t send us an email \u2013 we need it through the form).\n\nGood luck and see you in the castle!\n",
