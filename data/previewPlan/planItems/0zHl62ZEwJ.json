But here you are, ready to learn from, ride with and hang out with the man himself.\n\n\u200B\n\nIn this introduction, Ian Boswell shows you around the farmhouse, tells you a little bit about himself, and then sits you down over a coffee to explain what the week ahead holds. Not only will you get in plenty of riding during the week, but Ian will also show you secret swimming holes, how to chop wood, share a few of his favorite meals and buy you one of those ice cream cones he keeps going on about. Above all, he\u0027ll share his views on how to achieve a balance between life, work, and sport - a recipe he\u0027s successfully applying in the latest chapter of his life.\n\n\u200B\n\n_Schedule for A Week with Ian Boswell:_\n\n_Day 1/7: Introduction \u0026 Morning Routine_\n\n_Day 2/7: Strength Endurance_\n\n_Day 3/7: Off_\n\n_Day 4/7: Race Winning Efforts_\n\n_Day 5/7: Creemee Ride_\n\n_Day 6/7: Off_\n\n_Day 7/7: Spikes_\n",
