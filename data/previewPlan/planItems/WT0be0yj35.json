The constant surging below, at, and well above threshold push your ability to recover to the max, making this a fantastic session for building your Anaerobic Capacity (AC). Since you are often forced to \u201Crecover\u201D at high intensities, your cardiovascular system hardly gets a real break, which means your Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) gets pushed hard too. With each effort ending in an all-out sprint, you really get to test out how much you have left in the tank. You might surprise yourself.\n",

Cadence builds improve how you recruit your leg, gluteal, and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke by progressing to your maximal cadence. By reaching your highest cadence possible, you are training the \u0027on/off\u0027 switch in each muscle group to not only work faster but to have less overlap with your other muscle groups. This session trains your hamstring muscles to \u0027turn off\u0027 when your quads \u0027turn on\u0027 and vice-versa, resulting in a more efficient pedal stroke at both high and low cadences.\n\n\u200B\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to The Knowledge podcast, by Wahoo Sports Science - The Benefits of High Cadence Training: [https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence](https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence)\n",

This session is designed to sharpen muscle activation and improve recovery after intense efforts.\n\nFinish strong, and I\u2019ll see you in Burgberg!\n\n\u200B\n\nWith short near-maximal sprint efforts like these, you\u2019ll recruit all of the muscle fibers in your legs. While cadence builds force your muscles to contract and relax as quickly as possible, this session forces your muscles to contract with maximal power. Just like cadence builds, this session becomes one of the best ways to train your neuromuscular system.\n\nEven if your target event does not require you to complete maximal sprints, there is a substantial trickle-down efficiency effect to the longer-duration power efforts when you train your neuromuscular system.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/9866624296)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

          "description": "In this session, you will be going straight from a max 20-second high torque starting effort into 40 seconds right at MAP. The Starting effort should just about completely drain your Anaerobic Capacity, which will leave you gasping for air as you start each 40-second MAP effort. By forcing yourself to maintain MAP after a maximal sprint, you are asking your body to increase oxygen supply to your muscles as quickly as possible by increasing your heart rate and breathing rate. Being able to increase oxygen consumption rapidly means your body will better handle changes in pace both above and below threshold.\n\n\u200B\n\nWhat you need to do:\n\n- You will need to begin each Standing Start at super low RPM\u0027s with very high torque (high resistance). To maximize muscle recruitment you want to both push-down and pull-up on the pedals at the start. Proper core engagement is a must, as your legs need a sturdy backboard to push against.\n- You\u0027ll want the starting resistance to be just high enough that only your max effort can get the pedals moving; after those first few revs your goal is to get your cadence up as high as possible by the end of the 20 seconds. The best way to ensure you have the right resistance is to complete this session in slope mode rather than ERG mode.\n- Once the 20-second start is over you want to settle right into the 40-second effort at MAP, avoiding any significant drop in power at the transition point. Since the goal of this 40-second MAP effort is maximal cardiovascular demand, aim to hold your cadence 10-15 RPM higher than you would for the 5-minute test in Full Frontal.\n\nFor Time Trialists and Triathletes:\n\nAfter the Standing Start, you will want to get into your aerobars and hold the same position you will be competing in. Those on regular road bikes should get down into the drops.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n15 minute @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n3 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of sets: 5\n\nRest between sets: 15 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nInterval repeats per set: NA\n\n**Interval**\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 180% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n40 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 95-105%% of MAP (115-135% of FTP)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n8 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR \u003C70%\n",

This session is designed to sharpen muscle activation and improve recovery after intense efforts.\n\nFinish strong, and I\u2019ll see you in Burgberg!\n\n\u200B\n\nWith short near-maximal sprint efforts like these, you\u2019ll recruit all of the muscle fibers in your legs. While cadence builds force your muscles to contract and relax as quickly as possible, this session forces your muscles to contract with maximal power. Just like cadence builds, this session becomes one of the best ways to train your neuromuscular system.\n\nEven if your target event does not require you to complete maximal sprints, there is a substantial trickle-down efficiency effect to the longer-duration power efforts when you train your neuromuscular system.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/9866624296)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty. As founder of The Col Collective, Mike has made a career out of riding, filming, and telling the story of epic rides and mountains across the continent. As your On Location co-creator and host, Mike\u0027s engaging character, curious mind, and friendly nature will have you cueing up your next ride with him before you\u0027ve even finished the cool-down._\n",

          "description": "This skills session is designed to develop skills for a variety of challenging course conditions and mimic scenarios you will encounter on race day. The skills practiced here are done at race pace so you can focus on proper execution while under pressure. To properly complete this ride you will need to find a field with the following features and bring along some equipment:  \n  \n- A set of stairs, ideally with enough area at the top to practice re-mounting your bike.  \n- A flat, open area to practice Figure 8s. Use water bottles or cones to mark the corners.  \n- A hill to practice off-camber riding.  \n- Barriers about shin high, which can be made from PVC pipe or improvised using your imagination (and a few water bottles).  \n- BONUS: an area with sand or deep and loose dirt.  \n  \nHere\u2019s how to tackle this session:  \n  \nWarm-up for 10-15 minutes Z1/Z2 spinning, include two 3-5 second hard accelerations.  \n  \nHole Shot \u002B Stairs. Complete 2 sets:  \nSimulate your race start by lining up 300-400m away from the stairs, in your starting gear and with one foot unclipped.  \nCountdown from 10 and you\u2019re OFF! Clip in and complete an all out 15 second effort.  \nWork on shifting up smoothly during the effort as you would in a race.  \nContinue the effort around Z3/Z4 effort for 60 seconds while riding towards the base of the stairs.  \nDismount and run up the stairs and remount at the top.  \nBetween the first and second set, do 50-100m of Field Running.  \n  \nBarriers. Complete 4-6 sets:  \nSet up some barriers (you can make a portable set from PVC pipe, or you can use some water bottles and your imagination).  \nStarting about 100m out from your barriers, speed towards the barriers at race pace.  \nThe challenge is to focus on the timing of your dismount and remount and to keep you leg speed high between the barriers in order to maintain the most momentum.  \n  \nFigure 8s. Complete 5-10 minutes:  \nFor more info on Figure 8s read \u201CTips for Figure 8s\u201D.  \nSet up 2 bottles about 30m apart and practice your Figure 8s.  \nTo simulate a race scenario, drive your first 3-4 pedal strokes super hard coming out of each \u201Cturn\u201D.  \nAlternate seated efforts and standing efforts and experiment with your gearing to find the best fit for your desired cadence and power.  \n  \nSand Pit. Complete 5-10 minutes:  \nIf you also have access to a sand pit then finish with 4-6 efforts through the sand. See \u201CTips For Sand\u201D to master this skill.  \nFinish with 5-10 minutes of easy spinning to cool down.  \n  \n**Warm-Up **8 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%  \n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%  \n1 minutes @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%  \n10 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 150% of FTP -- HR \u003C 100%  \n50 seconds @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C 70%  \n10 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 150% of FTP -- HR \u003C 100%  \n4 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%  \n  \n**Main Effort **  \nNumber of Sets: 4  \nRest Between Sets: 2 minutes  \nInterval Repeats per Set: 1  \n**Interval**  \n8 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70% focusing on assigned skill  \n2 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%  \n  \n**Extra volume **  \nN/A  \n  \n**Cool Down **  \n5 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%  \n",

Don\u2019t feel the need to practice every section you struggle with, but use today\u0027s ride as an opportunity to practice your skills at race pace!\n\nKeep the effort below 110% of FTP but spend the bulk of the ride at 75-85% of FTP.\n\n\u200B\n\nMake sure to warm up well before hitting race pace and cool down afterwards.\n",

          "description": "Meandering along the scenic River Iller, it\u2019s time to break out your gravel bike for a classic cadence build and hold session. We\u2019ll kick off with 5 x 30-second cadence builds, allowing for 2 minutes of recovery between each, before moving on to 5 x 60-second cadence holds, again with 2 minutes recovery.\n\nWhile this session may be short, it\u2019s a key part of your weekly plan, designed to keep you efficient and in top form, even when the cadence ramps up. Stay smooth and steady\u2014and remember, \u201Cno bobbing!\u201D\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Builds:** The name of the game here is absolute peak cadence, not peak power. To achieve this, you need to be in a small gear and have very light resistance. Starting at 90-RPM, steadily increase your cadence until you reach your absolute max with about 5-seconds left, and hold that to the end. Your limiting factor on these efforts needs to be leg speed. If resistance/power output is your limiting factor, try starting in an easier gear, or shift into an easier gear 15-seconds in. Bouncing in the saddle is okay for this drill.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Holds**: These efforts require you to maintain the highest cadence you can without starting to bounce in the saddle. For some of you that will be 100-RPM, for others, it will be 150-RPM. The key is to settle into YOUR peak sustainable cadence. Like the Builds, the goal here is not high power, so these efforts are limited to 90% of FTP. Do not be surprised if your heart rate is well into Zone 4 by the time you hit the last few holds.\n\n\nTo properly execute this session, your effort between drills needs to be low. With limited recovery time between these maximal Neuromuscular Efforts, riding above Zone 1 between efforts will only reduce your ability to max out your cadence. While the power targets between are Zone 1, do not be surprised if your heart rate does not drop below Zone 2 after the first couple builds.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/9885886076)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty. As founder of The Col Collective, Mike has made a career out of riding, filming, and telling the story of epic rides and mountains across the continent. As your On Location co-creator and host, Mike\u0027s engaging character, curious mind, and friendly nature will have you cueing up your next ride with him before you\u0027ve even finished the cool-down._\n",

          "description": "This skills session is designed to mimic a variety of challenging course conditions and scenarios you will encounter on race day. The skills practiced here are done below race pace so you can focus on proper execution. To properly complete this ride you will need to find a field with the following features and bring along some equipment:  \n  \nA set of stairs, ideally with enough area at the top to practice re-mounting your bike.  \nA flat, open area to practice Figure 8s. Use water bottles or cones to mark the corners.  \nA hill to practice off-camber riding.  \nBarriers about shin high, which can be made from PVC pipe or improvised using your imagination (and a few water bottles).  \n  \nHere\u2019s how to tackle this session:  \n  \nWarm-up for 10-15 minutes Z1/Z2 spinning, include 2 x 1 minute Z3 efforts to warm up.  \n  \nStairs. Complete 3-4 sets:  \nApproach the stairs at a decent speed (but don\u2019t go over a Z3 effort).  \nDismount and focus on the technique needed to maintain your momentum up the stairs. Experiment with both the timing of your dismount and how you hold your bike while running up the stairs. You may wish to sling it over your shoulder or pick it up by the top tube and handlebars.  \nAt the top remount as smoothly as possible while trying to maintain your forward momentum.  \n  \nFigure 8s. Complete 5-10 minutes:  \nFor more info on Figure 8s read \u201CTips for Figure 8s\u201D.  \nSet up two bottles or cones roughly 20m apart and practice your Figure 8s.  \nFocus on maintaining your speed, and try to avoid accelerating or surging out of the \u201Cturns\u201D.  \nIf you\u2019re feeling frisky you can break up the Figure 8s with 50-75m Field Runs every couple minutes.  \n  \nBarriers. Complete 4-8 sets:  \nNext, set up some barriers (you can make a portable set from PVC pipe, or you can use some water bottles and your imagination).  \nHit your barrer section at a decent speed (again trying to avoid going over Z3).  \nPractice and perfect the timing of your dismount and remount. The key here is keeping your leg speed quick and nimble between the barriers!  \n  \nOff-Camber Riding. Complete 5-10 minutes:  \nRide to the top of the hill and then ride along the length of the crest. Try to hold a straight line while not gaining or losing elevation.  \nTurn around and ride it in the opposite direction.  \nAs your off-camber skills develop you can try riding faster and faster to see where your limit is, and sometimes that means going over it! Be safe, but remember that you won\u2019t know what you can and can\u2019t do until you try!  \n  \nFinish with 5-10 minutes of easy spinning to cool down.  \n  \n**Warm-Up  \n**8 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%  \n1 minutes @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%  \n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%  \n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C 80%  \n4 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%  \n  \n**Main Effort  \n**Number of Sets: 4  \nRest Between Sets: 2 minutes  \nInterval Repeats per Set: 1  \n**Interval  \n**8 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70% focusing on assigned skill  \n2 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%  \n  \n**Extra Volume  \n**N/A  \n  \n**Cool Down  \n**5 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%  \n",

          "description": "Tempo sessions are always a great time to work on pace control, especially Tempo efforts longer than 30 minutes. We are taking that pacing demand a bit further in this session by forcing you to slightly increase your effort as time goes on. This is referred to as a \u0022Negative-Split\u0022, meaning the second half is faster (or you hold a higher power) than the first half.\n\n\u200B\n\nWhile you might question the benefit of doing \u0022easier\u0022 tempo efforts, the truth is when riding between 80% and 100% of FTP your body processes oxygen and metabolites at nearly the same rate. Holding a higher power will give you a higher single day training stimulus, but looking at the big picture that can have its drawbacks. Mainly the fatigue those harder sessions cause, which requires easier workouts the days before and after. Sticking to the Tempo targets gets you nearly the same training stimulus while allowing you to hit harder sessions the rest of the week.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session contains a single 60-minute tempo effort, broken into three 20-minute segments. You will spend the first 20-minutes at 80% of FTP, the next 20 at 84%, and the final 20 at 87%. By the time you hit the last 10-minutes of this effort, that 87% will feel much harder than it should. Another way of thinking about this one, if you were to reverse the order, and start at 87%, what you would likely find is that your RPE stays fairly consistent for the entire effort, even though the power targets are dropping.\n\n\u200B\n\nOverheating, not drinking enough, being under-fueled and mental fatigue will all play a factor in how you feel in that final block. They will also impact your heart rate. While these power targets are usually associated with Zone 3 heart rate, many people will see their heart rate climb into low Z4 if they are not hydrating properly, or have inadequate cooling. This can be a great session to act as a \u0022wake up call\u0022 on any poor training habits you might have so take note and aim to address those issues during your next workout.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n30 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 8 -- 105% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of sets: NA\n\nRest between sets: NA\n\nInterval repeats per: NA\n\n**Interval**\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 6 -- 80% of FTP -- HR \u003C100\n\n20 minutes@ RPE 6.5 -- 84% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 7 -- 87% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n45 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

          "description": "You can never have too many tools in the shed. After years of lobbying, we finally convinced Grunter von Agony to share his favorite set of implements with us: the fabled _14 Vise Grips_. Taken individually, each of the 14 intervals might appear tame, incapable of inflicting a significant squeeze. But when expertly applied in the correct order, they apply just the right kind of pressure to turn a Couchlandrian into a Sufferlandrian, just like turning coal into diamonds.\n\n\u200B\n\nWhile the duration of each Vise Grip varies (from 30 seconds to 2 minutes), the power targets and recovery durations between them remain constant. The first 30-second interval should feel like a Sunday stroll in the park, but by the end of the first 2-minute Vise Grip, you\u0027ll be cursing Grunter\u0027s name. As the intervals get shorter, time will appear to stretch. That final 30-second effort will feel like an eternity. When you roll up to the second set, you\u0027ll know what you\u0027re in for, so just put your head down and prepare yourself to crush or be crushed.\n\n\u200B\n\nOnce you make it through all 14 Vise Grips, you will have been north of your Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) for a total of 16 minutes. Changing the duration of the efforts (while keeping the same recovery) stresses your Anaerobic Capacity (AC) in a more dynamic way than, say, a more straightforward on/off session like _Half is Easy_. Since the longer efforts have the same recovery duration as the shorter ones, you will eventually deplete your AC, forcing your body to rely on your MAP to hit the required power targets. As the intervals get shorter in the second half of each set, you\u0027ll find that you have just enough left in the tank to complete the next effort.\n\n\u200B\n\nUltimately this workout combines the advantages of shorter, higher-power intervals with longer recovery (great for building muscular strength) with the advantages of longer, higher-power intervals with inadequate recovery (great for driving up your MAP and improving your AC).\n",

The aim is to help you finish strong \u2014 not fade \u2014 by learning how to pace properly through effort buildup.\n\n\u200B\n\nSet on the steady slopes of Coll de Rates, the consistent gradient supports rhythm and control, allowing you to focus on cadence, breathing, and technique as you go deeper into the red.

          "description": "They say that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. And through the bleeding eyes of Sufferlandrians, what could possibly be more beautiful than the sharp, saw-tooth profile of the workout you see before you? Full of gorgeous, shapely, shimmering blocks of yellow Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) efforts interspersed with mercifully brief and slightly inadequate recoveries, it\u0027s a real stunner.\n\n\u200B\n\nBut you know what\u0027s even better looking than this alluring workout? You (after you\u0027ve completed the workout, that is). Originally designed by our Head of Sports Science, Neal Henderson, for his professional athletes, The Model is a beautiful portrait of MAP brutality. It\u0027s one of those sessions that you think you can\u0027t finish, but always somehow do. It will leave you breathless, feeling all tingly, a bit confused and lying in a blubbering heap. It\u0027s a look. It will also deliver a nice boost to your fitness that always looks and feels good.\n\n\u200B\n\nA true love letter to the beauty of professional cycling, The Model features a banging soundtrack and thrilling footage from both the men\u0027s and women\u0027s pelotons. With its eclectic design, effects, and graphics, you\u0027ll find yourself unable to tear your eyes away from the action on screen (assuming you can lift them from your stem).\n",

          "description": "Meandering along the scenic River Iller, it\u2019s time to break out your gravel bike for a classic cadence build and hold session. We\u2019ll kick off with 5 x 30-second cadence builds, allowing for 2 minutes of recovery between each, before moving on to 5 x 60-second cadence holds, again with 2 minutes recovery.\n\nWhile this session may be short, it\u2019s a key part of your weekly plan, designed to keep you efficient and in top form, even when the cadence ramps up. Stay smooth and steady\u2014and remember, \u201Cno bobbing!\u201D\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Builds:** The name of the game here is absolute peak cadence, not peak power. To achieve this, you need to be in a small gear and have very light resistance. Starting at 90-RPM, steadily increase your cadence until you reach your absolute max with about 5-seconds left, and hold that to the end. Your limiting factor on these efforts needs to be leg speed. If resistance/power output is your limiting factor, try starting in an easier gear, or shift into an easier gear 15-seconds in. Bouncing in the saddle is okay for this drill.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Holds**: These efforts require you to maintain the highest cadence you can without starting to bounce in the saddle. For some of you that will be 100-RPM, for others, it will be 150-RPM. The key is to settle into YOUR peak sustainable cadence. Like the Builds, the goal here is not high power, so these efforts are limited to 90% of FTP. Do not be surprised if your heart rate is well into Zone 4 by the time you hit the last few holds.\n\n\nTo properly execute this session, your effort between drills needs to be low. With limited recovery time between these maximal Neuromuscular Efforts, riding above Zone 1 between efforts will only reduce your ability to max out your cadence. While the power targets between are Zone 1, do not be surprised if your heart rate does not drop below Zone 2 after the first couple builds.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/9885886076)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty. As founder of The Col Collective, Mike has made a career out of riding, filming, and telling the story of epic rides and mountains across the continent. As your On Location co-creator and host, Mike\u0027s engaging character, curious mind, and friendly nature will have you cueing up your next ride with him before you\u0027ve even finished the cool-down._\n",

          "description": "These two mini Pyramids of Power might remind you of The Shovel... This one, however is a little less focused on Anaerobic Capacity and a little more on muscle endurance, due to that big blue block in the middle. The first pyramid will begin to fatigue your muscles and tax your AC before you face 20 minutes at tempo. With both of those efforts under your belt, the second pyramid will drain the rest of your AC and ask your aerobic system to pick up the slack. This might even feel similar to a mountain bike or cyclocross race effort- you take it out hard, jockeying for the hole shot or a front pack position before getting into the technical elements. Then you settle into a sustainable effort for a short while, maybe working with a couple others before battling it out for your final finishing position.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n9 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4 -- 70% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n**Build x3**\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n1 minute 30 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of sets: 2\n\nRest between sets: 20 minutes @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR \u003C100\n\nInterval repeats per set: 1\n\n**Interval **\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 200% of FTP -- \u003E105%\n\n50 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 9.5 -- 180% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n40 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 150% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n40 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n50 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n50 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n40 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 150% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 9.5 -- 180% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n40 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 200% of FTP -- \u003E105%\n\n7 minutes 30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume **\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down **\n\n10 minutes 40 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n",

          "description": "This skills session is designed to mimic a variety of challenging course conditions and scenarios you will encounter on race day. The skills practiced here are done below race pace so you can focus on proper execution. To properly complete this ride you will need to find a field with the following features and bring along some equipment:  \n  \nA set of stairs, ideally with enough area at the top to practice re-mounting your bike.  \nA flat, open area to practice Figure 8s. Use water bottles or cones to mark the corners.  \nA hill to practice off-camber riding.  \nBarriers about shin high, which can be made from PVC pipe or improvised using your imagination (and a few water bottles).  \n  \nHere\u2019s how to tackle this session:  \n  \nWarm-up for 10-15 minutes Z1/Z2 spinning, include 2 x 1 minute Z3 efforts to warm up.  \n  \nStairs. Complete 3-4 sets:  \nApproach the stairs at a decent speed (but don\u2019t go over a Z3 effort).  \nDismount and focus on the technique needed to maintain your momentum up the stairs. Experiment with both the timing of your dismount and how you hold your bike while running up the stairs. You may wish to sling it over your shoulder or pick it up by the top tube and handlebars.  \nAt the top remount as smoothly as possible while trying to maintain your forward momentum.  \n  \nFigure 8s. Complete 5-10 minutes:  \nFor more info on Figure 8s read \u201CTips for Figure 8s\u201D.  \nSet up two bottles or cones roughly 20m apart and practice your Figure 8s.  \nFocus on maintaining your speed, and try to avoid accelerating or surging out of the \u201Cturns\u201D.  \nIf you\u2019re feeling frisky you can break up the Figure 8s with 50-75m Field Runs every couple minutes.  \n  \nBarriers. Complete 4-8 sets:  \nNext, set up some barriers (you can make a portable set from PVC pipe, or you can use some water bottles and your imagination).  \nHit your barrer section at a decent speed (again trying to avoid going over Z3).  \nPractice and perfect the timing of your dismount and remount. The key here is keeping your leg speed quick and nimble between the barriers!  \n  \nOff-Camber Riding. Complete 5-10 minutes:  \nRide to the top of the hill and then ride along the length of the crest. Try to hold a straight line while not gaining or losing elevation.  \nTurn around and ride it in the opposite direction.  \nAs your off-camber skills develop you can try riding faster and faster to see where your limit is, and sometimes that means going over it! Be safe, but remember that you won\u2019t know what you can and can\u2019t do until you try!  \n  \nFinish with 5-10 minutes of easy spinning to cool down.  \n  \n**Warm-Up  \n**8 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%  \n1 minutes @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%  \n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%  \n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C 80%  \n4 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%  \n  \n**Main Effort  \n**Number of Sets: 4  \nRest Between Sets: 2 minutes  \nInterval Repeats per Set: 1  \n**Interval  \n**8 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70% focusing on assigned skill  \n2 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%  \n  \n**Extra Volume  \n**N/A  \n  \n**Cool Down  \n**5 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%  \n",

While it\u0027s not as comprehensive or as accurate as our main fitness test, _Full Frontal_, it\u0027s far more approachable and easier to pace for new riders. It also doesn\u0027t require any special preparation. You just need to feel relatively fresh.\n\n\u200B\n\nBased on more than a year of research (and after dozens of lab tests and thousands of online tests) and using sophisticated analysis of power and heart rate data, _Half Monty_ is far more accurate and comprehensive than standard ramp tests.\n\n\u200B\n\nIt also tells you more about who you are as an athlete. _Half Monty_ provides you with your FTP, Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP), and Cycling Threshold Heart Rate (cTHR), all of which we use to personalize your workout targets.\n\n\u200B\n\nIf you\u0027re still using the 4DP estimates when you set up your account, _Half Monty_ will also refine your AC and NM estimates (but will not do so if you\u0027ve done _Full Frontal_ or manually adjusted your estimates). If you want fully accurate AC and NM, as well as your Rider Type, Strengths, Weaknesses, and training plans adjusted to those Strengths and Weaknesses, you\u0027ll need to expose yourself to the _Full Frontal_ 4DP fitness test.\n\n\u200B\n\nReady to climb the ramp? You\u0027ll need the following before you start:\n\n- A heart rate monitor if you want the most accurate results. Don\u0027t have one? Order one [HERE](https://wahoofitness.com/devices)\n- Some kind of power device connected (trainer, power meter, virtual power, etc.)\n- Be ready to pay close attention to the instructions in the workout\n- Be sure your profile is complete and up-to-date (Profile \u003E About You). Accurate information helps us make our calculations\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to \u0027[Why Fitness Testing Matters](https://the-knowledge-by-wahoo-sports-science.simplecast.com/episodes/testing-testing-1-2-3-why-fitness-testing-matters)\u0027 on The Knowledge Podcast by Wahoo Sports Science.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s some more information on how to get the most from your fitness test.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterFitnessAssessment)\n",

Cash Register is an adaptation of that idea and comes in the format of a sprint/settle/surge session consisting of 4 intervals that get a little shorter (but not easier) each round.\n\n\u200B\n\nEach interval kicks off with a sprint effort that targets your Neuromuscular (NM) power. Then you settle into a controlled, below-FTP effort that will accelerate the rate at which you can clear lactate from your muscles. You\u0027ll finish each effort off with a big surge based on your Anaerobic Capacity (AC). In just 30 minutes, you\u0027ll be doing efforts targeting your sprint power, FTP, and AC for an exceptionally well-rounded workout.\n\n\u200B\n\nSupport the Wahooligan Tour by [donating to the Davis Phinney Foundation](https://secure2.convio.net/dpf/site/TR?pg=pfind\u0026fr_id=1391) and their programs to help people living with Parkinsons.\n",

          "description": "One of the best sessions for neuromuscular training, this drill asks you to progressively build from a cadence of 90 RPM to your MAX over 30 seconds, recover, and repeat several times. Cadence builds improve how you recruit your leg, gluteal, and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke by progressing to your maximal cadence. By reaching your highest cadence possible, you are training the \u0027on/off\u0027 switch in each muscle group to not only work faster but to have less overlap with your other muscle groups. This session trains your hamstring muscles to \u0027turn off\u0027 when your quads \u0027turn on\u0027 and vice-versa, resulting in a more efficient pedal stroke at both high and low cadences.\n\n\u200B\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to The Knowledge podcast, by Wahoo Sports Science - The Benefits of High Cadence Training: [https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence](https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence)\n",

First, a variety of longer efforts build sustained power while also making sure you\u0027re sufficiently fatigued. This initial beatdown is necessary to ensure you get the maximum benefit from _Blender_\u0027s infamous \u0027Pain Shakes.\u0027 Three sets of these little devils help you develop a supernatural ability to recover from big efforts. The bonus is that you also beef up your ability to produce high-end power, building Anaerobic Capacity and Maximal Aerobic Power simultaneously.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe threshold efforts at the end are the bitter cherry on the sundae, improving your body\u0027s ability to produce aerobic power and helping make sure your FTP will get the same boost as your AC and MAP. A rising tide of lactic acid raises all boats. Oh, and clocking in at one hour and 40 minutes, Blender will also help whip your endurance into a frenzy.\n",

It trains your ability to generate force through the pedals by ensuring you recruit ALL of your muscles to get those cranks turning. No matter your preferred discipline, these efforts are key to teaching your body to recruit all of the muscle fibers in your legs.\n\n\u200B\n\nAll of the benefits in this session come from hitting these 20-second efforts as hard as you possibly can. To do that, you need full recovery between each sprint, and you need to respect that recovery. These efforts should see you start at super low RPMs with very high torque. As you start and increase the effort, your cadence will naturally increase. **Your goal is to get your cadence as high as possible by the end of each 20-second effort.** To maximize your muscle recruitment, you want to both push down and pull up on the pedals at the start. Proper core engagement is a must - your legs need a good strong backboard to push against.\n\n\u200B\n\nWe understand that not everyone\u0027s trainer has the necessary resistance or the required stability to perform this workout as described. If you can\u0027t safely stand up, then you can get much of the same benefit by doing these efforts seated. If your trainer can\u2019t handle the rapid change in speed or does not have high enough resistance at a super low cadence, then you can start the efforts at a higher cadence and treat them as \u201Cnormal\u201D all-out sprints.\n",

          "description": "This skills session is designed to mimic a variety of challenging course conditions and scenarios you will encounter on race day. The skills practiced here are done below race pace so you can focus on proper execution. To properly complete this ride you will need to find a field with the following features and bring along some equipment:  \n  \nA set of stairs, ideally with enough area at the top to practice re-mounting your bike.  \nA flat, open area to practice Figure 8s. Use water bottles or cones to mark the corners.  \nA hill to practice off-camber riding.  \nBarriers about shin high, which can be made from PVC pipe or improvised using your imagination (and a few water bottles).  \n  \nHere\u2019s how to tackle this session:  \n  \nWarm-up for 10-15 minutes Z1/Z2 spinning, include 2 x 1 minute Z3 efforts to warm up.  \n  \nStairs. Complete 3-4 sets:  \nApproach the stairs at a decent speed (but don\u2019t go over a Z3 effort).  \nDismount and focus on the technique needed to maintain your momentum up the stairs. Experiment with both the timing of your dismount and how you hold your bike while running up the stairs. You may wish to sling it over your shoulder or pick it up by the top tube and handlebars.  \nAt the top remount as smoothly as possible while trying to maintain your forward momentum.  \n  \nFigure 8s. Complete 5-10 minutes:  \nFor more info on Figure 8s read \u201CTips for Figure 8s\u201D.  \nSet up two bottles or cones roughly 20m apart and practice your Figure 8s.  \nFocus on maintaining your speed, and try to avoid accelerating or surging out of the \u201Cturns\u201D.  \nIf you\u2019re feeling frisky you can break up the Figure 8s with 50-75m Field Runs every couple minutes.  \n  \nBarriers. Complete 4-8 sets:  \nNext, set up some barriers (you can make a portable set from PVC pipe, or you can use some water bottles and your imagination).  \nHit your barrer section at a decent speed (again trying to avoid going over Z3).  \nPractice and perfect the timing of your dismount and remount. The key here is keeping your leg speed quick and nimble between the barriers!  \n  \nOff-Camber Riding. Complete 5-10 minutes:  \nRide to the top of the hill and then ride along the length of the crest. Try to hold a straight line while not gaining or losing elevation.  \nTurn around and ride it in the opposite direction.  \nAs your off-camber skills develop you can try riding faster and faster to see where your limit is, and sometimes that means going over it! Be safe, but remember that you won\u2019t know what you can and can\u2019t do until you try!  \n  \nFinish with 5-10 minutes of easy spinning to cool down.  \n  \n**Warm-Up  \n**8 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%  \n1 minutes @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%  \n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%  \n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C 80%  \n4 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%  \n  \n**Main Effort  \n**Number of Sets: 4  \nRest Between Sets: 2 minutes  \nInterval Repeats per Set: 1  \n**Interval  \n**8 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70% focusing on assigned skill  \n2 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%  \n  \n**Extra Volume  \n**N/A  \n  \n**Cool Down  \n**5 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%  \n",

          "description": "These two mini Pyramids of Power might remind you of The Shovel... This one, however is a little less focused on Anaerobic Capacity and a little more on muscle endurance, due to that big blue block in the middle. The first pyramid will begin to fatigue your muscles and tax your AC before you face 20 minutes at tempo. With both of those efforts under your belt, the second pyramid will drain the rest of your AC and ask your aerobic system to pick up the slack. This might even feel similar to a mountain bike or cyclocross race effort- you take it out hard, jockeying for the hole shot or a front pack position before getting into the technical elements. Then you settle into a sustainable effort for a short while, maybe working with a couple others before battling it out for your final finishing position.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n9 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4 -- 70% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n**Build x3**\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n1 minute 30 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of sets: 2\n\nRest between sets: 20 minutes @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR \u003C100\n\nInterval repeats per set: 1\n\n**Interval **\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 200% of FTP -- \u003E105%\n\n50 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 9.5 -- 180% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n40 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 150% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n40 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n50 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n50 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n40 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 150% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 9.5 -- 180% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n40 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 200% of FTP -- \u003E105%\n\n7 minutes 30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume **\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down **\n\n10 minutes 40 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n",

Cadence builds improve how you recruit your leg, gluteal, and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke by progressing to your maximal cadence. By reaching your highest cadence possible, you are training the \u0027on/off\u0027 switch in each muscle group to not only work faster but to have less overlap with your other muscle groups.

It trains your ability to generate force through the pedals by ensuring you recruit ALL of your muscles to get those cranks turning. No matter your preferred discipline, these efforts are key to teaching your body to recruit all of the muscle fibers in your legs.\n\n\u200B\n\nAll of the benefits in this session come from hitting these 20-second efforts as hard as you possibly can. To do that, you need full recovery between each sprint, and you need to respect that recovery. These efforts should see you start at super low RPMs with very high torque. As you start and increase the effort, your cadence will naturally increase. **Your goal is to get your cadence as high as possible by the end of each 20-second effort.** To maximize your muscle recruitment, you want to both push down and pull up on the pedals at the start. Proper core engagement is a must - your legs need a good strong backboard to push against.\n\n\u200B\n\nWe understand that not everyone\u0027s trainer has the necessary resistance or the required stability to perform this workout as described. If you can\u0027t safely stand up, then you can get much of the same benefit by doing these efforts seated. If your trainer can\u2019t handle the rapid change in speed or does not have high enough resistance at a super low cadence, then you can start the efforts at a higher cadence and treat them as \u201Cnormal\u201D all-out sprints.\n",

          "description": "This skills session is designed to develop skills for a variety of challenging course conditions and mimic scenarios you will encounter on race day. The skills practiced here are done at race pace so you can focus on proper execution while under pressure. To properly complete this ride you will need to find a field with the following features and bring along some equipment:  \n  \n- A set of stairs, ideally with enough area at the top to practice re-mounting your bike.  \n- A flat, open area to practice Figure 8s. Use water bottles or cones to mark the corners.  \n- A hill to practice off-camber riding.  \n- Barriers about shin high, which can be made from PVC pipe or improvised using your imagination (and a few water bottles).  \n- BONUS: an area with sand or deep and loose dirt.  \n  \nHere\u2019s how to tackle this session:  \n  \nWarm-up for 10-15 minutes Z1/Z2 spinning, include two 3-5 second hard accelerations.  \n  \nHole Shot \u002B Stairs. Complete 2 sets:  \nSimulate your race start by lining up 300-400m away from the stairs, in your starting gear and with one foot unclipped.  \nCountdown from 10 and you\u2019re OFF! Clip in and complete an all out 15 second effort.  \nWork on shifting up smoothly during the effort as you would in a race.  \nContinue the effort around Z3/Z4 effort for 60 seconds while riding towards the base of the stairs.  \nDismount and run up the stairs and remount at the top.  \nBetween the first and second set, do 50-100m of Field Running.  \n  \nBarriers. Complete 4-6 sets:  \nSet up some barriers (you can make a portable set from PVC pipe, or you can use some water bottles and your imagination).  \nStarting about 100m out from your barriers, speed towards the barriers at race pace.  \nThe challenge is to focus on the timing of your dismount and remount and to keep you leg speed high between the barriers in order to maintain the most momentum.  \n  \nFigure 8s. Complete 5-10 minutes:  \nFor more info on Figure 8s read \u201CTips for Figure 8s\u201D.  \nSet up 2 bottles about 30m apart and practice your Figure 8s.  \nTo simulate a race scenario, drive your first 3-4 pedal strokes super hard coming out of each \u201Cturn\u201D.  \nAlternate seated efforts and standing efforts and experiment with your gearing to find the best fit for your desired cadence and power.  \n  \nSand Pit. Complete 5-10 minutes:  \nIf you also have access to a sand pit then finish with 4-6 efforts through the sand. See \u201CTips For Sand\u201D to master this skill.  \nFinish with 5-10 minutes of easy spinning to cool down.  \n  \n**Warm-Up **8 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%  \n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%  \n1 minutes @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%  \n10 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 150% of FTP -- HR \u003C 100%  \n50 seconds @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C 70%  \n10 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 150% of FTP -- HR \u003C 100%  \n4 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%  \n  \n**Main Effort **  \nNumber of Sets: 4  \nRest Between Sets: 2 minutes  \nInterval Repeats per Set: 1  \n**Interval**  \n8 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70% focusing on assigned skill  \n2 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%  \n  \n**Extra volume **  \nN/A  \n  \n**Cool Down **  \n5 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%  \n",

If you feel good and want to push the pace, go for it! If you find a section that you struggle to hit cleanly, repeat it a few times until you feel comfortable with it.

Yet, as I came to realize, the harsh truths of traveling in such a formidable environment were a long way from the romantic images I\u2019d held of this land. _The Frozen Road_\u2019 is an honest reflection on my solo trip; of the wonder, terror and frustration I experienced when riding through the unforgiving emptiness of one of the world\u2019s \u2018last great wildernesses.\u0022\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: The workout accompanying this film is a recovery session.

The term \u0022Taper\u0022 refers to how you train in the week or so before your target event to ensure you deliver your best performance. Generally, tapering means reducing your total training volume but continuing to hit some high-intensity efforts. While there are individual variations in the best way to taper, this session has been used by countless professionals leading into the biggest races of their lives -- athletes like World Champions Rohan Dennis and Flora Duffy.\n\n\u200B\n\nWith 3 sets of micro-intervals (40/20s, 30/30s, and 20/40s) you will hit your system with just enough intensity to keep your legs sharp and responsive, without adding any real fatigue. Outside of those 3 sets of micro-intervals, this session is purposefully short and easy. This is a preparation session, not a training session! After all, your event is just around the corner and all of the important training is behind you. Riding harder or longer today will do absolutely nothing to increase your fitness by event day; in fact, all that would do is increase your fatigue, which will only hurt your performance. Rather, this session makes sure your body is humming along and ready to perform on the big day.\n",

This includes everything from your powerful glutes, hamstrings, and calves to the postural muscles of your upper back and neck._\n\n\u200B\n\nYour posterior chain is responsible for back and hip extension as well as knee flexion. It is vital in maintaining optimal posture during cycling and running in addition to water position in swimming. In this first session, we introduce some basic movements that focus on the activation and stabilization of posterior chain muscles. These moves include a combination of eccentric (lengthening), concentric (shortening), and isometric (holding) contractions. They provide your body with the foundation for more demanding moves to come. This is also a good session to come back to if you feel like you could use a quick posterior chain activation or tune-up.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?

It introduces the most basic versions of moves that make up the majority of this program. Some of these moves may seem very basic but we encourage you to focus on perfect form and execution during these early levels so that when we turn up the heat you have things nailed. As you\u0027ll see, all the exercises at the lower levels will progress in a similar fashion going forward. We\u0027re building strength, but also fine-tuning your nervous system. As the program progresses you\u0027ll be asked to complete more difficult variations on each foundational move.\n\n\u200B\n\nAs with all the strength training routines, it helps if you\u2019ve done a warm-up before getting started. That can be one of your favorite yoga routines, riding your bike on the trainer for 5-10 minutes, or doing a personal stretching routine.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?

The goal is not to develop big muscles in your arms and chest, but to build basic functional strength to help you improve stability and become a more well-rounded athlete.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis extra work is derived from more difficult variations of the foundation moves. While the added upper-body component will decrease the number of reps you can complete in a set, your primary goal remains to nail perfect form. Even though you\u0027ve been at this for several weeks your nervous system is still learning these movement patterns.

This sequence will be beneficial for endurance sports where you need some upper body strength and improved posture, such as swimming, cycling (especially MTB and Cyclocross), and running. To help ensure overall strength, this routine incorporates some core muscle exercises and you may find some portions of the sequence difficult. No problem! Take your time to understand the movement. Pause the video if you need to and embrace the process of mastering new exercises.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?

For those who can practice Wheel safely, it serves as an excellent counterpose to common postures from cycling or sitting at a desk, potentially alleviating lower back, upper back, and shoulder pain. For those not yet ready for Wheel, the other poses in this sequence are also effective for addressing muscular imbalances.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe objectives are to increase spinal and shoulder mobility, stretch the abs, chest, and fronts of the shoulders, open up the hip flexors, activate the glutes, and help alleviate lower and upper back pain.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Poses in this session:**\n\n- Supported Bridge\n- Thunderbolt\u2014Shoulder Rolls\n- Kneeling Cat-Cow\n- Puppy\n- Downward Facing Dog\n- Cobra\n- Low Lunge with Shoulder Opener\n- Bridge\n- Wheel\n- Windscreen Wipers\n",
