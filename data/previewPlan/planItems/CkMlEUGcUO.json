This includes everything from your powerful glutes, hamstrings, and calves to the postural muscles of your upper back and neck._\n\n\u200B\n\nYour posterior chain is responsible for back and hip extension as well as knee flexion. It is vital in maintaining optimal posture during cycling and running in addition to water position in swimming. In this first session, we introduce some basic movements that focus on the activation and stabilization of posterior chain muscles. These moves include a combination of eccentric (lengthening), concentric (shortening), and isometric (holding) contractions. They provide your body with the foundation for more demanding moves to come. This is also a good session to come back to if you feel like you could use a quick posterior chain activation or tune-up.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?

This includes everything from your powerful glutes, hamstrings, and calves to the postural muscles of your upper back and neck._\n\n\u200B\n\nThe second session in this series focuses on activating and strengthening key structural stability muscles and developing optimal tension throughout the body. To do this, we use a combination of isolated and integrated movements in a variety of body positions and build on the movements from Posterior Chain 1. We also introduce tempo movements that require extra focus on timing and eccentric loading. Even though this is only Level 2, you may find some of these moves difficult to perform. That\u0027s ok, take your time and focus on performing the moves correctly even if you have to pause the video.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?

So nicely, in fact, that you\u2019re ready for a more demanding session. This workout includes compound sets which are more difficult but, most importantly, more beneficial than simply doing more sets of a single move. This is because your nervous system has to work overtime to cope with the variety. The number of reps per set is also higher, which will help drive continuous improvement.\n\n\u200B\n\nSince this is a longer session, you may experience considerable fatigue on your first time through.

This keeps your body adapted while allowing it to fully recover. To make the most out of your strength gains, you need to balance the hard work with adequate recovery. Given how short this session is, we strongly recommend completing a supplementary Yoga Session after this video. Something like Improving Posture, Shake Off the Day or Recovery Booster would be perfect.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Exercises Included**\n\n- Kneeling Hip Drive with Hands Over Head\n- Kneeling Hip Drive with Hips Side to Side\n- High Plank to Pigeon Pose\n- Plank with Leg Lifts\n- Hip Bridge with Reps\n- Fast Lateral Lunges with Knees Up\n- Standing Hip Drive with Hands Up\n- Standing Hip Drive with Hands Side to Side\n",

Given how short this session is, we strongly recommend also doing a Yoga Session in the app first.
