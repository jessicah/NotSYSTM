This plan will ensure that you nail the stages that matter most for your continued improvement.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Coach Neal says to expect the following with this option:**\n\n- You might find it frustrating to keep the intensity low(er) on days when you feel great, but rest assured the Tour will still grind you down\u2026but not so much that you won\u2019t rise again for your goals down the road.\n- It\u2019s still going to be really hard, so it\u2019s critical to stay on top of nutrition, hydration and rest/recovery since you\u2019ll be riding 7 days straight.\n",

As the Team Leader at Rally Cycling, you\u0027re riding to defend a respectable 22nd position in the GC\u2014and perhaps even break the top 10. Today\u0027s stage is on a hilly, punchy circuit. You\u0027ll need to put in some serious work to stay with the GC leaders if you want a chance of grabbing a top 10 GC result at the end of the Tour.\n\n\u200B\n\n**About ProRides**\n\nHere\u2019s your chance to experience what it\u2019s like to ride in the biggest races in the world, thanks to SYSTM\u2019s 4DP platform. We\u2019ve taken the first-person camera footage and power data from a pro cyclist and analyzed it to determine which part of their 4DP\u00AE profile each of their efforts corresponds to. But since few of us can put down pro-level watts, we made it so all of the efforts are scaled to your own personal 4DP\u00AE profile. That means you get to experience exactly what the pros experience relative to your own abilities. When they sprint, you sprint. When they attack, you attack. When they sit up, you get to take it (relatively) easy. It\u0027s the most immersive, realistic race simulation out there.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s some more information on how to create the most immersive ProRides experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterProRides)\n",

          "description": "One of the few Sufferfest sessions that can be viewed as a sweet-spot session since the intervals aren\u2019t above threshold (except for the very end) but are harder than a tempo effort.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session pushes your body close to the limit of what it can comfortably handle without going any further. Why? Going above threshold causes a considerable amount of hormonal stress that takes a lot of time to recover from. But you don\u2019t actually have to ride above threshold to improve your FTP. The difference in fitness gains between 30 minutes at 90% of threshold and at 102% of threshold is minimal. Still, the stress on your body from the latter is much greater, and the recovery much longer.\n\n\u200B\n\nThat\u0027s why this session is a key component to any training plan: It gives you enough training stress to help improve your FTP but remains \u0027easy\u0027 enough that you can do it when you\u0027re tired or before a big block of harder efforts.\n",

Both sets of intervals are designed to have equal work to rest ratios, so the longer intervals have longer recovery time afterward. This first set will begin to deplete your Anaerobic Capacity (AC), and by the end, your aerobic system will have to work overtime to help keep the power up. And keep the power up you will, since as the intervals get shorter they also get harder.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe second interval set follows the same pattern as the first, ensuring both your AC and Maximal Aerobic Power are pushed towards their limit. To give it that extra kick, we added a couple of 30-second efforts with 30 seconds of recovery (having flashbacks to Pain Shakes from _Blender_, are we?). These final efforts are just hard enough\u2014with just enough rest\u2014that you will fully deplete your AC, forcing your MAP to pick up the slack.\n",

First, a variety of longer efforts build sustained power while also making sure you\u0027re sufficiently fatigued. This initial beatdown is necessary to ensure you get the maximum benefit from _Blender_\u0027s infamous \u0027Pain Shakes.\u0027 Three sets of these little devils help you develop a supernatural ability to recover from big efforts. The bonus is that you also beef up your ability to produce high-end power, building Anaerobic Capacity and Maximal Aerobic Power simultaneously.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe threshold efforts at the end are the bitter cherry on the sundae, improving your body\u0027s ability to produce aerobic power and helping make sure your FTP will get the same boost as your AC and MAP. A rising tide of lactic acid raises all boats. Oh, and clocking in at one hour and 40 minutes, Blender will also help whip your endurance into a frenzy.\n",

          "description": "Over/under intervals, where you alternate going just below and just above threshold, are the foundation of many classic workouts. Cash Register is an adaptation of that idea and comes in the format of a sprint/settle/surge session consisting of 4 intervals that get a little shorter (but not easier) each round.\n\n\u200B\n\nEach interval kicks off with a sprint effort that targets your Neuromuscular (NM) power. Then you settle into a controlled, below-FTP effort that will accelerate the rate at which you can clear lactate from your muscles. You\u0027ll finish each effort off with a big surge based on your Anaerobic Capacity (AC). In just 30 minutes, you\u0027ll be doing efforts targeting your sprint power, FTP, and AC for an exceptionally well-rounded workout.\n\n\u200B\n\nSupport the Wahooligan Tour by [donating to the Davis Phinney Foundation](https://secure2.convio.net/dpf/site/TR?pg=pfind\u0026fr_id=1391) and their programs to help people living with Parkinsons.\n",
