The shorter, super-high intensity efforts also help with your Neuromuscular Power (NM). The second set features inverse intervals with opposite efforts and recoveries. This really depletes your body\u0027s AC, so you need to rely on your aerobic system. This helps develop your Maximal Aerobic Power.\n",

Since you are often forced to \u201Crecover\u201D at high intensities, your cardiovascular system hardly gets a real break, which means your Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) gets pushed hard too. With each effort ending in an all-out sprint, you really get to test out how much you have left in the tank. You might surprise yourself.\n",

Each 8-minute set gives you more than five minutes at 90% or higher of your 5-minute peak power. By the end, you\u0027re looking at 16 minutes of accumulated MAP efforts, so get ready to say \u0027Hello, Pain!\u0027\n\nAlong the way, we\u0027ll give you some interesting mental tips on how to prepare for, and better manage, the discomfort (to put it mildly) that comes with such intense efforts.

Click [\u002B\u002Bhere\u002B\u002B](https://wahoox.forum.wahoofitness.com/t/wahoo-november-challenge-groundwork/30430) to find out more.\n\n\u200B\n\nOn the surface, this seems like a rather tame session: a series of intervals that are all under five minutes and which are almost all under threshold. But there is more here than the power file shows. The lack of obvious intensity in these short intervals is made up for by the very low cadence targets each effort requires. This creates minimal cardiovascular stress but places a tremendous load on your muscular system. The goal is to keep your upper body absolutely rock solid during these efforts. If you find that you bob back and forth for each pedal stroke, then your core is not up to the task your legs are giving it (better get onto our yoga videos and strengthen that core).\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session can be a great test to see how your lower back will hold up over a longer ride outside. A core that will fail you after 3 hours of road riding can often be identified fairly quickly during this session. If your back is burning just as badly as your legs, it\u0027s a signal to do some additional core strengthening. With so much stress on your muscles, this is a great session for improving your overall endurance and your ability to produce lots of high torque, giving your Neuromuscular Power a nice boost along the way.\n\n\u200B\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to \u0027[When to Train with Low Cadence](https://the-knowledge-by-wahoo-sports-science.simplecast.com/episodes/when-to-train-with-low-cadence)\u0027 on The Knowledge Podcast by Wahoo Sports Science.\n",

With large continuous blocks above threshold, and the only \u201Crecovery\u201D coming in the form of tempo efforts (but only after massive surges), you need to bring your A-game to make it through this one. Actually, bring your A\u002B game.\n\n\u200B\n\nWith so much time right at or above threshold you really push your ability to efficiently produce aerobic power to its limits, which is the key to a quality FTP session (when you are fresh).

          "description": "Do you know what we love about you? Your versatility. You can Suffer anywhere, anytime, and in any way. That\u0027s why Grunter von Agony, Sufferlandrian Team Director, is sending you to compete in The Omnium at the UCI World Track Championships. Over the course of 50 minutes, you\u0027ll do battle in the six different races.\n\n\u200B\n\nNo two intervals in this workout are the same, with each one working slightly different Neuromuscular (NM), Anaerobic Capacity (AC), and Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) variations. No need for FTP here, friends. It\u0027s the perfect session to improve top-end power without having to do a ton of repetitive efforts.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe Scratch Race and Flying Lap have an easy enough lead-in that you get to put your max sprint to the full test. Add in the standing starts for the Individual Pursuit and Kilo, and you give your NM a real run-through. The repeated surges of the Elimination Race, the all-out nature of the Kilo, and the massive efforts you have to make in the points race really test your powers of recovery while working your AC all the way to the max.\n\n\u200B\n\nSince the efforts come in quick succession, and with most being over four minutes in length, your cardiovascular system never catches a real break, ensuring your MAP doesn\u2019t get left out of the equation.\n",

This takes you further, deeper, and darker than that. _A Very Dark Place_ (AVDP) is about maximum effort for shorter durations: five, four-minute intervals that take you to the limit. If you struggle with longer, high-intensity efforts and want to improve your ability to make repeated attacks, you need to spend some time in _A Very Dark Place_. Those little punches in the third and fifth efforts will teach you just how dark it can get.\n",

          "description": "The simple idea of going hard for one minute and then easy for one minute, and then repeating, has been around since whatever evil genius realized that intervals were the best way to train. There is a reason this simple session has stuck around: it works.\n\n\u200B\n\n30 seconds into a high-intensity effort, enough of your anaerobic energy sources have been depleted that your body shifts to producing that power aerobically. Follow that effort with only 60 seconds of recovery, and your body hasn\u2019t fully replenished those anaerobic stores, meaning it will have to produce that power aerobically after just 25 seconds.\n\n\u200B\n\nWith a total of just 15 (cough, cough) efforts, you will have not only forced your body to replenish its Anaerobic Capacity (AC) over and over, but you\u0027ve just spent several minutes producing lots of power with lots of oxygen. That combination ensures this session hits both your Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) and AC with just the right stress they need to start increasing.\n\n\u200B\n\n_Revolver has recently been remastered (Aug \u002722) to include all new footage and music. The workout has a longer warm-up than previous editions._\n",

The pain will come.\n\n\u200B\n\nDuring each interval, you\u0027ll be ducking and diving right under and over threshold, forcing your body to churn through all the metabolites you\u0027re producing (that\u0027s the nasty stuff that the Painsuckers love so much). This is one of the best ways to improve your FTP without really overloading your system with too much training stress.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe final two intervals allow you to really charge over your threshold to unleash whatever power you have left in your legs. These two all-out bursts of power, in addition to the constant surges above threshold, means this session works your Anaerobic Capacity more than some of the other FTP-focused sessions.\n",
