Compelled by Jack London\u2019s assertion, that \u2018any man who is a man can travel alone,\u0027 I sought an adventure of perfect solitude. Yet, as I came to realize, the harsh truths of traveling in such a formidable environment were a long way from the romantic images I\u2019d held of this land. _The Frozen Road_\u2019 is an honest reflection on my solo trip; of the wonder, terror and frustration I experienced when riding through the unforgiving emptiness of one of the world\u2019s \u2018last great wildernesses.\u0022\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: The workout accompanying this film is a recovery session. It\u0027s a very low-intensity ride, with your power remaining at or below 50% of FTP (an RPE less than 2.5 on a scale from 1 to 10) and your heart rate in Zone 1. The intensity and cadence targets will vary throughout this session to keep it interesting, but not so much that it distracts you from the story.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s how to turn off on-screen graphics for the best viewing experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterInspiration)\n",

          "description": "This is a technique-focused session designed to develop your agility, stability, range of motion, and foot speed. There is no focus on heart rate zones so you may choose to leave your monitor at home for these sessions. Between sets of each drill, you should jog/walk easily to fully recover between the efforts. While these efforts shouldn\u2019t be too taxing on you, the key is perfect form, so you want to be hitting each one rested enough that you can maintain great form for the duration. You should take a bit of extra rest between techniques, again to ensure you are rested and can nail the form. Before starting the workout, familiarize yourself with the format for high knees, butt kicks, skipping, carioca and strides. Find a flat track, field, or 50-100m of open space to perform this workout (football and soccer fields are great for this).\n\n\u200B\n\nFor help understanding your run workout and calculating your pace zones, please see [this article](https://wahoosystm.com/RunningSessionFAQ).\n\nLearn how to perform your [**Running Drills**](https://support.wahoofitness.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404080091922-Running-Drills) here.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-up:**\n\nStart off with 5-10 minutes of easy jogging/walking.\n\nHigh Knees: 2-3 sets of 50m high knees.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- Take short strides, bringing your knees up high enough that your upper legs are parallel to the ground. Focus on achieving high knees AND quick turnover, or performing as many reps as possible in a short distance.\n\n**Butt Kicks:**\n\n2-3 sets of 50m butt kicks.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- This should actually look similar to a high knee drill, but with the heels coming up to touch the bottom of your butt. Take short strides while using your hamstrings to lift your heels up beneath your butt. Your knees should come up in front of your body while pulling your heels up beneath your hips, rather than keeping your quads and knees below and in line with your hips.\n\n**Skipping:**\n\n3-4 sets of 50m skipping.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- Focus on a high knee drive and swinging your arms at your sides like you would when running.\n\n**Carioca:**\n\n4 sets of 30m Carioca in each direction (8 total).\n\nRest for 20 seconds between direction changes (at your discretion).\n\n- For this drill, you need to face sidewise to the direction you want to go. Start off moving to the right. Bring your left knee up and across your body and put your left foot in front of your right foot. Step your right foot to the right so it is parallel with your left leg again (at this point you should be positioned in the same direction and orientation that you were at the start. Next step your left leg behind your right leg, again so it lands on the right side of your right leg. Then bring your right leg back across your body, once again ending up in the starting position. Repeat this pattern for 25-30m.\n\n**Strides:**\n\n2-3 sets of 60m; Gradually build effort from RPE 3-8.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between. These are comprised of a steady acceleration over 60-80m up to 5k pace. The goal is to increase speed after each step, so you are reaching maximum speed at the end of the 60-80m stretch. You want to focus on keeping your shoulders, neck, and jaw relaxed while maintaining strong knee drive, straight and compact arm swing, planting the feet beneath the hips, and fast turnover.\n\n\u200B\n\nHigh Knees \u002B Butt Kicks:\n\nFinish these drills with one set each of 50m high knees and butt kicks.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool-down:**\n\nWalk or jog for 5 minutes to cool down.\n\nIn case you need to brush up on your running [drills](https://wahoosystm.com/RunningSessionFAQ)\n",

          "description": "This workout combines several technique driven intervals. These will improve your overall form and efficiency on the bike. The first two drills, Cadence Holds and Builds, are designed to improve the way you recruit your leg, glute and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke. They do this by forcing you to sustain a cadence just above \u0027comfortable\u0027 and by pushing you to your maximal cadence.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe last drill, Single Leg Efforts, ask you to unclip one leg and ride at a steady, single-legged effort. This forces you to pull up on the pedal instead of just pushing down and ensures maximal muscle awareness and engagement. This workout is best done while riding indoors on a trainer because even small variations in terrain can affect your ability to properly execute this workout. The majority of this workout is done in heart rate Z1/2 /// 50-75% of threshold /// RPE 2-5. You should keep the effort level below threshold (heart rate Z4, 100% of threshold, RPE 7-8) during the max cadence efforts.\n\n\u200B\n\nWORKOUT GOALS:\n\n- To improve stillness and stability at high cadences.\n- To improve muscle fiber engagement for improved efficiency at all cadences.\n- To increase maximum cadence.\n- To make that pedal stroke as smooth as butter.\n\nCADENCE TARGETS:\n\n- Warm-up 80-90rpm\n- Build: 90-150rpm\n- Hold: 115rpm\n- Single Leg: 85rpm\n\nListen to The Knowledge podcast, by Wahoo Sports Science - The Benefits of High Cadence Training: [https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence](https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n3 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 3\n\nRest Between Sets: 8 minutes @ RPE 23 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: N/A\n\n**Interval**\n\nCadence Build: 30 seconds @ RPE 8 -- Starting at 90RPM Build to Max RPM -- Max Power is NOT Goal\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nCadence Hold: 45 seconds @ RPE 7.5 -- \u003C100% FTP -- Highest RPM you can hold without Bouncing\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nSingle Leg: 1 minute @ RPE 6 -- Single Leg Only -- \u003C50% of FTP\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nSingle Leg: 1 minute @ RPE 6 -- Single Leg Only, Opposite Leg -- \u003C50% of FTP (100% of FTP with both legs = 50% of FTP\n\nwith one leg)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n8 minutes 15 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

          "description": "Tempo sessions are always a great time to work on pace control. We are taking that pacing demand a bit further in this session by forcing you to slightly increase your effort as time goes on. This is referred to as a \u0022Negative-Split\u0022, meaning the second half is faster (or you hold a higher power) than the first half.\n\n\u200B\n\nWhile you might question the benefit of doing \u0022easier\u0022 tempo efforts, the truth is when riding between 80% and 100% of FTP your body processes oxygen and metabolites at nearly the same rate. Holding a higher power will give you a higher single day training stimulus, but looking at the big picture that can have its drawbacks. Mainly the fatigue those harder sessions cause, which requires easier workouts the days before and after. Sticking to the Tempo targets gets you nearly the same training stimulus while allowing you to hit harder sessions the rest of the week.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session contains a single 30-minute tempo effort, broken into three 10-minute segments. You will spend the first 10-minutes at 80% of FTP, the next 10 at 84%, and the final 10 at 87%. By the time you hit the last 10-minutes of this effort, that 87% will feel much harder than it should. Another way of thinking about this one, if you were to reverse the order, and start at 87%, what you would likely find is that your RPE stays fairly consistent for the entire effort, even though the power targets are dropping.\n\n\u200B\n\nOverheating, not drinking enough, being under-fueled and mental fatigue will all play a factor in how you feel in that final block. They will also impact your heart rate. While these power targets are usually associated with Zone 3 heart rate, many people will see their heart rate climb into low Z4 if they are not hydrating properly, or have inadequate cooling. This can be a great session to act as a \u0022wake up call\u0022 on any poor training habits you might have, so take note and aim to address those issues during your next workout.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n30 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7 -- 90% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C95%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 8 -- 110% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: N/A\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 1\n\n**Interval**\n\nEffort 1: 10 minutes @ RPE 6 -- 80% of FTP-- HR \u003C85%\n\nEffort 2: 10 minutes @ RPE 6 -- 83% of FTP-- HR \u003C90%\n\nEffort 3: 10 minutes @ RPE 6 -- 87% of FTP-- HR \u003C95%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n1 hour 15 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C85%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- \u003C45% of FTP -- HR \u003C 70%\n",

          "description": "The goal of this workout is to help develop your baseline aerobic fitness. While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high and your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week. Shorter Endurance rides (like this one) can fit in both a hard week of training and a recovery week. That is, only if you do it right! Most people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022\n\n\u200B\n\nTruth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride, especially one under 90 minutes should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted.\n\nSo what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like? For 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70%, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in low to mid Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can; for most this is 80-90rpm. Also, your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster, but you will have to trust us on this one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions, or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: 4\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nNA\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

          "description": "Tempo sessions are always a great time to work on pace control, especially Tempo efforts longer than 30 minutes. We are taking that pacing demand a bit further in this session by forcing you to slightly increase your effort as time goes on. This is referred to as a \u0022Negative-Split\u0022, meaning the second half is faster (or you hold a higher power) than the first half.\n\n\u200B\n\nWhile you might question the benefit of doing \u0022easier\u0022 tempo efforts, the truth is when riding between 80% and 100% of FTP your body processes oxygen and metabolites at nearly the same rate. Holding a higher power will give you a higher single day training stimulus, but looking at the big picture that can have its drawbacks. Mainly the fatigue those harder sessions cause, which requires easier workouts the days before and after. Sticking to the Tempo targets gets you nearly the same training stimulus while allowing you to hit harder sessions the rest of the week.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session contains a single 60-minute tempo effort, broken into three 20-minute segments. You will spend the first 20-minutes at 80% of FTP, the next 20 at 84%, and the final 20 at 87%. By the time you hit the last 10-minutes of this effort, that 87% will feel much harder than it should. Another way of thinking about this one, if you were to reverse the order, and start at 87%, what you would likely find is that your RPE stays fairly consistent for the entire effort, even though the power targets are dropping.\n\n\u200B\n\nOverheating, not drinking enough, being under-fueled and mental fatigue will all play a factor in how you feel in that final block. They will also impact your heart rate. While these power targets are usually associated with Zone 3 heart rate, many people will see their heart rate climb into low Z4 if they are not hydrating properly, or have inadequate cooling. This can be a great session to act as a \u0022wake up call\u0022 on any poor training habits you might have so take note and aim to address those issues during your next workout.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n30 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 8 -- 105% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of sets: NA\n\nRest between sets: NA\n\nInterval repeats per: NA\n\n**Interval**\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 6 -- 80% of FTP -- HR \u003C100\n\n20 minutes@ RPE 6.5 -- 84% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 7 -- 87% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n45 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

          "description": "The goal of this workout is to help develop your baseline aerobic fitness. While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high and your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week. Shorter Endurance rides (like this one) can fit in both a hard week of training and a recovery week. That is, only if you do it right! Most people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022\n\n\u200B\n\nTruth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride, especially one under 90 minutes should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted.\n\nSo what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like? For 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70%, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in low to mid Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can; for most this is 80-90rpm. Also, your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster, but you will have to trust us on this one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions, or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: 2\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nNA\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

          "description": "Just like Fight Club and Who Dares, this session is all about surging well above threshold, and then trying to recover without dropping your power anywhere close to your recovery zone. The 2 things that make this session stand out are:\n\n1. You only have one single continuous effort (which happens to be 60-minutes in length)\n2. Your recovery power is low Tempo, which is good because any higher than that and you wouldn\u0027t last the full 60 minutes!\n\nAs you increase intensity from 80% of FTP up to 100% of FTP, your legs begin to produce more and more metabolites, but the rate at which your body CAN clear them is almost the same. As you close in on 100% of FTP you suddenly are at a point where production of metabolites equals your clearance rate. Now move just a bit over FTP and those metabolites are going to continue to build until you drop your effort back below FTP.\n\n\nTo improve your bodies clearance rate for those metabolites, you need to spend a decent amount of time with more of those metabolites in your system than your bodies current clearance rate can handle.\n\n\nThat is what this session is all about, short hard efforts above FTP to build an excess of metabolites, followed by steady riding at 80% of FTP. This steady-state effort between surges is high enough that your body will still be working at max clearance rates but low enough that you can keep doing those surges over and over again, which is good for you because this is not a short interval.\n\n\nWhile you can achieve the same training stimuli by holding shorter blocks above FTP, those sessions have their drawbacks. The main one is nailing the exact right intensity above FTP that will allow you to accumulate enough time in that metabolite flooded state. While we like to think our FTP is set in stone, the reality is it can fluctuate from day to day, which makes finding that balancing point for a session like that so difficult. You can easily go too hard and blow up early, or not go hard enough and never really push that clearance rate to the max. By hitting surges well above FTP, then holding an effort a good deal below FTP, any day to day variation in your FTP becomes less of an issue because you never have to dance 5W above or below it.\n\n\nThe added benefit to this Surge and Settle workout style is the boost it can give to your Anaerobic Capacity. An improved AC means you can recover faster, not just from sprint type efforts, but from repeated MAP and FTP efforts as well.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up **\n\n40 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 8 -- 105% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of Sets: 12\n\nRest between sets: 4 minutes 40 seconds @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR \u003C100\n\nInterval repeats per: NA\n\n**Interval **\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume **\n\n1 hour 35 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down **\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR \u003C70%\n",

While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are just times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right!\n\n\u200B\n\nMost people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022 Truth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted. So what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like?\n\nFor 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70% is ok, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm and your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster. You will have to trust us on that one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions! Or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\nWarm-Up\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\nMain Effort\n\nNumber of Sets\n\n5\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set\n\n1\n\nInterval: 10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n\u200B\n\nExtra Volume\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\nCool Down\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

The blend between mind and body, working together to overcome hard moments\u2014be it physical, mental or emotional\u2014and how we learn to cope in our own mind is essential in being able to process the past, be true to ourselves in the present, and create moments of inner peace in the future.\n\n\u200B\n\nA decade after crossing the French Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es non-stop on a ride that would act as a catalyst for change, I wanted to share this story for the first time. To give an insight into the deeper meaning behind some of the mountain challenges you may have seen me undertake over the years, I felt now was the time to head back to my mountains, return to source, and embrace the unknown.\n\n\u200B\n\nOvercoming the mountains of our mind, from escapism to reconnection. 10 years, 10 cols and 10,000 meters of climbing. This is my story of going Full Circle.\n\n\u200B\n\nThank you for watching. I truly hope there is something in this video that can help you in your own journey.\n\n\u200B\n\nPeace,\n\nMike Cotty\u0022\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: The workout accompanying this film is a recovery session, which is a very low-intensity ride. It\u0027s so easy that your power remains at or below 50% of FTP or an RPE less than 2.5, and your heart rate stays in zone 1 the entire time. The intensity and cadence targets will vary throughout this session to keep it interesting (But not so interesting that you can\u0027t pay attention to the film).\n",

While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are just times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right!\n\n\u200B\n\nMost people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022 Truth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted. So what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like?\n\nFor 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70% is ok, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm and your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster. You will have to trust us on that one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions!

Most people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022\n\n\u200B\n\nTruth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride, especially one under 90 minutes should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted.\n\nSo what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like? For 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70%, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in low to mid Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can; for most this is 80-90rpm. Also, your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster, but you will have to trust us on this one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions, or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: 2\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nNA\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

          "description": "You can never have too many tools in the shed. After years of lobbying, we finally convinced Grunter von Agony to share his favorite set of implements with us: the fabled _14 Vise Grips_. Taken individually, each of the 14 intervals might appear tame, incapable of inflicting a significant squeeze. But when expertly applied in the correct order, they apply just the right kind of pressure to turn a Couchlandrian into a Sufferlandrian, just like turning coal into diamonds.\n\n\u200B\n\nWhile the duration of each Vise Grip varies (from 30 seconds to 2 minutes), the power targets and recovery durations between them remain constant. The first 30-second interval should feel like a Sunday stroll in the park, but by the end of the first 2-minute Vise Grip, you\u0027ll be cursing Grunter\u0027s name. As the intervals get shorter, time will appear to stretch. That final 30-second effort will feel like an eternity. When you roll up to the second set, you\u0027ll know what you\u0027re in for, so just put your head down and prepare yourself to crush or be crushed.\n\n\u200B\n\nOnce you make it through all 14 Vise Grips, you will have been north of your Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) for a total of 16 minutes. Changing the duration of the efforts (while keeping the same recovery) stresses your Anaerobic Capacity (AC) in a more dynamic way than, say, a more straightforward on/off session like _Half is Easy_. Since the longer efforts have the same recovery duration as the shorter ones, you will eventually deplete your AC, forcing your body to rely on your MAP to hit the required power targets. As the intervals get shorter in the second half of each set, you\u0027ll find that you have just enough left in the tank to complete the next effort.\n\n\u200B\n\nUltimately this workout combines the advantages of shorter, higher-power intervals with longer recovery (great for building muscular strength) with the advantages of longer, higher-power intervals with inadequate recovery (great for driving up your MAP and improving your AC).\n",

          "description": "In this workout, the shorter the interval duration, the higher the power target will be. Starting from 20 minutes of low Tempo, and finishing with 4-minutes of high-quality MAP work, proper pacing is crucial to success in this workout. While you could easily be above target power for the entire 20-minute effort, that would set you up to fail in the last two efforts. Be smart and pace yourself; you can always go harder in the final 5-minute effort if you want to!\n\n\nAt any intensity above Endurance pace, the longer you ride, the more fatigued you become. Completing the final 5-minute target when fresh would be unpleasant, hitting it after all of these other intervals makes it a near maximal effort. Proper hydration/cooling and nutrition are vital if you want to nail this workout.\n\n\nIf you are preparing for any longer ride/event where you will be required to keep on the gas from start to finish, this is the perfect session for you. Completing these efforts in this order not only gives a great physical training boost but also toughens you up mentally. Digging deep when fatigued is the key to good performance over longer distances, so expect to suffer in that final 5-minute effort; it will pay off both mentally and physically!\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up **\n\n30 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 4, all unique\n\nRest Between Sets: 12 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: N/A\n\n**Set 1** (20-minute Effort)\n\nSteady: 20 minutes @ RPE 7 -- 85% of FTP-- HR \u003C95%\n\n**Set 2** x4(16-minute Effort) \n\nSteady: 3 minutes @ RPE 7.25 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\nSurge: 1 minute @ RPE 7.75 -- 105% of FTP-- HR \u003C105%\n\n**Set 3 **(8-minute Effort)\n\nSurge: 1 minute @ RPE 8 -- 90% of MAP (105-125% of FTP)\n\nSteady: 6 minutes @ RPE 7.25 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\nSurge: 1 minute @ RPE 9 -- 95% of MAP (110-135% of FTP)\n\n**Set 4 **(4-minute Effort)\n\nEffort 1: 1 minute @ RPE 8 -- 90% of MAP (105-125% of FTP)\n\nEffort 2: 1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP\n\nEffort 3: 1 minute @ RPE 8 -- 90% of MAP (105-125% of FTP)\n\nEffort 4: 1 minute @ RPE 9.5 -- 100\u002B% of MAP (120-150% of FTP)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume **\n\n55 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C85%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down **\n\n6 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- \u003C45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n",

          "description": "The goal of this workout is to help develop your baseline aerobic fitness. While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are just times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right!\n\n\u200B\n\nMost people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022 Truth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted. So what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like?\n\nFor 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70% is ok, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm and your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster. You will have to trust us on that one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions! Or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\nWarm-Up\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\nMain Effort\n\nNumber of Sets\n\n5\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set\n\n1\n\nInterval: 10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n\u200B\n\nExtra Volume\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\nCool Down\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

What is often missed in this project is that we truly believe in building a team, a family and more, that it would be even tougher to do alone. Sit down on your couch with some popcorn and a blanket, but don\u0027t forget to bring your friends - this one is full of moments that will make you want to get off the couch!\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: the workout accompanying this film varies from endurance to tempo to sub-threshold. The higher intensity efforts aren\u0027t the hardest you\u0027ll experience so that you can keep your attention on the film, however, they are just hard enough to help improve your FTP, oxygen utilization efficiency, and the ability to recover quickly between hard efforts. The workout intensity reflects the intensity of the riders in many places, so you may feel as if you\u0027re climbing Mont Ventoux or that you\u0027re a part of a sprint lead-out train on the run into the finish line.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s how to turn off on-screen graphics for the best viewing experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterInspiration)\n",

          "description": "While some of you will know this intensity level as \u0022Sweet-Spot\u0022, we prefer the name Sub-Threshold, because we want to drive home the fact that you should keep your power below FTP. In the same way that longer Tempo efforts can feel \u0022easy,\u0022 these shorter Sub-Threshold efforts can also feel \u0022easy\u0022. After all, if you can hold 100% of FTP for about an hour, then holding less than that for 5-minutes should be a piece of cake right? We know you can go harder for 5-minutes, but that is not what we are asking for.\n\nThis session is not intended to push you to your limits, nor is it designed to be a massive training load. The real purpose is to essentially keep your fatigue levels right where they are, by giving your body just enough intensity to ensure that you are not \u0022more recovered\u0022 after today.\n\nWhile some folks will say that there is no training benefit to such short Sub-Threshold efforts, when viewed in a bigger picture sense (like a 3-week training block) they can be the perfect efforts to ensure you get the most out of a longer training block.\n\nWe would even ask that you view this session as more of an assessment, rather than strictly a workout. That\u0027s because you should be comparing this power output to heart rate response and your own internal RPE. When you have heavy fatigue, your heart rate will struggle to hit its normal peaks. When fresh you would be getting into Z4 heart rate by the end of the last two intervals, and your RPE should never really climb above a 7. When holding onto excess fatigue, your heart rate won\u0027t climb above Z3, and your RPE will be above an 8. At the same time, if you have gained a significant amount of fitness, your Heart Rate will stay in Z3, and your RPE won\u0027t climb above 6. The secondary tell between improved fitness and fatigue is how quickly your heart rate drops after each effort. When fatigued, your heart rate won\u0027t drop below Z2 during the recovery.\n\nWhile it is easy to rely solely on Power, you should always refer back to RPE and Heart Rate, and today is the perfect session to practice comparing the 3.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n30 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: N/A\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 8\n\n**Interval**\n\nEffort: 4 minutes @ RPE 6 -- 90% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\nRecovery: 5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n30 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C85%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n3 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- \u003C45% of FTP -- HR \u003C 60%\n",

          "description": "The goal of this workout is to help develop your baseline aerobic fitness. While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are just times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right!\n\n\u200B\n\nMost people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022 Truth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted. So what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like?\n\nFor 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70% is ok, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm and your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster. You will have to trust us on that one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions! Or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\nWarm-Up\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\nMain Effort\n\nNumber of Sets\n\n8.5\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set\n\n1\n\nInterval: 10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n\u200B\n\nExtra Volume\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\nCool Down\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

In the first of a series of behind-the-scenes, unfiltered front-row access with team Lifeplus-Wahoo, MADE THIS is a collection of short films from MAAP Pro Team Racing that reveals what it takes to make a champion a champion.\n2. **Prepared for anything: **The excitement of Holy Week at the Tour de Flanders is upon us, and Team Lifeplus-Wahoo is gearing up for a challenging ride. With 163km to conquer, featuring 12 climbs and seven cobbled stretches, not to mention seven slippery flat stone sections\u2014all under a deluge of rain\u2014anything could happen.\n3. **Passion on the cobbles: **Join us as we dive deep into the chaotic and exhilarating world of the Paris-Roubaix, one of cycling\u0027s most grueling races. Amidst the cobblestones and mud, Team Lifeplus-Wahoo faces the ultimate test of endurance and skill. With a new lineup and high stakes, the team navigates the unpredictable nature of this legendary race, where luck can play a huge role and every second counts.\n4. **Home sweet home: **After a fallow year for the tour, the team are eager to push for results in front of an expectant crowd. But instead of the warm welcome on familiar roads, disaster strikes the first morning of the race. As national news of the unfortunate event breaks, the team are left wondering if they\u0027ll be able to compete or if this becomes a home visit to forget. What follows is a true act of human kindness and a gesture that symbolises the unifying bond of the women\u0027s pro peloton.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: The workout accompanying this film is a recovery session.

          "description": "Yep, there are good chunks of sub-threshold in here. But what makes this session special are the surges above threshold during each effort. Your body\u0027s ability to clear metabolites and process oxygen doesn\u0027t really change at 90% of FTP and above. What that means it that whether you are at 90% or 100% of FTP your body is clearing those things out at the same rate. It\u0027s just that at FTP your body is producing more of those metabolites that it is capable of clearing.\n\n\u200B\n\nBy surging above FTP you are creating metabolites faster than your body can clear them. If you were to settle into 100% of FTP, you would only be clearing things out at the rate you are producing them. That means whatever you have produced from that surge will just stay there. By dropping just below FTP your body is clearing things out faster than you are producing them. That means that the excess you got from that surge will slowly be cleared out.\n\n\u200B\n\nEach time a surge pops up during this workout, your body should have just about cleared what was made from the last surge. Not only does this push your body\u0027s ability to clear these things to the max, but it also teaches your mind to deal with the discomfort of burning lungs and legs associated with these efforts at or above threshold.\n\n\u200B\n\nA simpler way to think of this is that you are teaching your body and mind to \u0022recover\u0022 just below FTP. Not only does this help bump up your FTP, but it also helps you recover that much faster anytime you let off the gas, whether for a downhill, turn, or finding a good draft. Having the confidence that you can recover while feeling so uncomfortable can mean the difference between hanging onto to a new personal best and completely throwing in the towel.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis is the perfect session to practice your positive thinking from the Mental Toughness Program (If you haven\u0027t checked that out already you definitely should!).\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 5.5 -- 85% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 90-95% of AC (130-180% of FTP)\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 4\n\nRest between sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nInterval repeats per set: 4\n\n**Interval**\n\nWork: 30 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\nSteady: 2 minutes 30 seconds @ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n25 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR \u003C70%\n",

          "description": "The goal of this workout is to help develop your baseline aerobic fitness. While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are just times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right!\n\n\u200B\n\nMost people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022 Truth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted. So what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like?\n\nFor 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70% is ok, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm and your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster. You will have to trust us on that one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions! Or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\nWarm-Up\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\nMain Effort\n\nNumber of Sets\n\n8.5\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set\n\n1\n\nInterval: 10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n\u200B\n\nExtra Volume\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\nCool Down\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

          "description": "This is a technique-focused session designed to develop your agility, stability, range of motion, and foot speed. There is no focus on heart rate zones so you may choose to leave your monitor at home for these sessions. Between sets of each drill, you should jog/walk easily to fully recover between the efforts. While these efforts shouldn\u2019t be too taxing on you, the key is perfect form, so you want to be hitting each one rested enough that you can maintain great form for the duration. You should take a bit of extra rest between techniques, again to ensure you are rested and can nail the form. Before starting the workout, familiarize yourself with the format for high knees, butt kicks, skipping, carioca and strides. Find a flat track, field, or 50-100m of open space to perform this workout (football and soccer fields are great for this).\n\n\u200B\n\nFor help understanding your run workout and calculating your pace zones, please see [this article](https://wahoosystm.com/RunningSessionFAQ).\n\nLearn how to perform your [**Running Drills**](https://support.wahoofitness.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404080091922-Running-Drills) here.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-up:**\n\nStart off with 5-10 minutes of easy jogging/walking.\n\nHigh Knees: 2-3 sets of 50m high knees.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- Take short strides, bringing your knees up high enough that your upper legs are parallel to the ground. Focus on achieving high knees AND quick turnover, or performing as many reps as possible in a short distance.\n\n**Butt Kicks:**\n\n2-3 sets of 50m butt kicks.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- This should actually look similar to a high knee drill, but with the heels coming up to touch the bottom of your butt. Take short strides while using your hamstrings to lift your heels up beneath your butt. Your knees should come up in front of your body while pulling your heels up beneath your hips, rather than keeping your quads and knees below and in line with your hips.\n\n**Skipping:**\n\n3-4 sets of 50m skipping.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- Focus on a high knee drive and swinging your arms at your sides like you would when running.\n\n**Carioca:**\n\n4 sets of 30m Carioca in each direction (8 total).\n\nRest for 20 seconds between direction changes (at your discretion).\n\n- For this drill, you need to face sidewise to the direction you want to go. Start off moving to the right. Bring your left knee up and across your body and put your left foot in front of your right foot. Step your right foot to the right so it is parallel with your left leg again (at this point you should be positioned in the same direction and orientation that you were at the start. Next step your left leg behind your right leg, again so it lands on the right side of your right leg. Then bring your right leg back across your body, once again ending up in the starting position. Repeat this pattern for 25-30m.\n\n**Strides:**\n\n2-3 sets of 60m; Gradually build effort from RPE 3-8.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between. These are comprised of a steady acceleration over 60-80m up to 5k pace. The goal is to increase speed after each step, so you are reaching maximum speed at the end of the 60-80m stretch. You want to focus on keeping your shoulders, neck, and jaw relaxed while maintaining strong knee drive, straight and compact arm swing, planting the feet beneath the hips, and fast turnover.\n\n\u200B\n\nHigh Knees \u002B Butt Kicks:\n\nFinish these drills with one set each of 50m high knees and butt kicks.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool-down:**\n\nWalk or jog for 5 minutes to cool down.\n\nIn case you need to brush up on your running [drills](https://wahoosystm.com/RunningSessionFAQ)\n",

While it\u0027s not as comprehensive or as accurate as our main fitness test, _Full Frontal_, it\u0027s far more approachable and easier to pace for new riders. It also doesn\u0027t require any special preparation. You just need to feel relatively fresh.\n\n\u200B\n\nBased on more than a year of research (and after dozens of lab tests and thousands of online tests) and using sophisticated analysis of power and heart rate data, _Half Monty_ is far more accurate and comprehensive than standard ramp tests.\n\n\u200B\n\nIt also tells you more about who you are as an athlete. _Half Monty_ provides you with your FTP, Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP), and Cycling Threshold Heart Rate (cTHR), all of which we use to personalize your workout targets.\n\n\u200B\n\nIf you\u0027re still using the 4DP estimates when you set up your account, _Half Monty_ will also refine your AC and NM estimates (but will not do so if you\u0027ve done _Full Frontal_ or manually adjusted your estimates). If you want fully accurate AC and NM, as well as your Rider Type, Strengths, Weaknesses, and training plans adjusted to those Strengths and Weaknesses, you\u0027ll need to expose yourself to the _Full Frontal_ 4DP fitness test.\n\n\u200B\n\nReady to climb the ramp? You\u0027ll need the following before you start:\n\n- A heart rate monitor if you want the most accurate results. Don\u0027t have one? Order one [HERE](https://wahoofitness.com/devices)\n- Some kind of power device connected (trainer, power meter, virtual power, etc.)\n- Be ready to pay close attention to the instructions in the workout\n- Be sure your profile is complete and up-to-date (Profile \u003E About You). Accurate information helps us make our calculations\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to \u0027[Why Fitness Testing Matters](https://the-knowledge-by-wahoo-sports-science.simplecast.com/episodes/testing-testing-1-2-3-why-fitness-testing-matters)\u0027 on The Knowledge Podcast by Wahoo Sports Science.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s some more information on how to get the most from your fitness test.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterFitnessAssessment)\n",

The blend between mind and body, working together to overcome hard moments\u2014be it physical, mental or emotional\u2014and how we learn to cope in our own mind is essential in being able to process the past, be true to ourselves in the present, and create moments of inner peace in the future.\n\n\u200B\n\nA decade after crossing the French Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es non-stop on a ride that would act as a catalyst for change, I wanted to share this story for the first time. To give an insight into the deeper meaning behind some of the mountain challenges you may have seen me undertake over the years, I felt now was the time to head back to my mountains, return to source, and embrace the unknown.\n\n\u200B\n\nOvercoming the mountains of our mind, from escapism to reconnection. 10 years, 10 cols and 10,000 meters of climbing. This is my story of going Full Circle.\n\n\u200B\n\nThank you for watching. I truly hope there is something in this video that can help you in your own journey.\n\n\u200B\n\nPeace,\n\nMike Cotty\u0022\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: The workout accompanying this film is a recovery session, which is a very low-intensity ride. It\u0027s so easy that your power remains at or below 50% of FTP or an RPE less than 2.5, and your heart rate stays in zone 1 the entire time. The intensity and cadence targets will vary throughout this session to keep it interesting (But not so interesting that you can\u0027t pay attention to the film).\n",

It explores extraordinary personal stories of ordinary cyclists taking on iconic endurance event Chase The Sun, revealing the power of the humble bicycle to transform lives and help save the planet.\n\nThe film features contributions from broadcaster and ITV\u2019s voice of the Tour de France Ned Boulting, author and blogger Jools Walker, Turner Prize-winning artist Sir Richard Long and 4x Mountain Bike World Champion Tracy Moseley.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: the workout accompanying this film varies from endurance to tempo to sub-threshold. The higher intensity efforts aren\u0027t the hardest you\u0027ll experience so that you can keep your attention on the film, however, they are just hard enough to help improve your FTP, oxygen utilization efficiency, and the ability to recover quickly between hard efforts. The workout intensity reflects the intensity of the riders in many places, so you may feel as if you\u0027re climbing Mont Ventoux or that you\u0027re a part of Cav\u0027s lead-out train on the run into the finish line.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s how to turn off on-screen graphics for the best viewing experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterInspiration)\n",

The 22km climb is long, so we break it up into three sections for you. First, you\u0027ll have a nice long warm-up to ride into the village of Fabian. Once the proper climb starts, you\u0027ll ramp it up to a range between 70-90% threshold and hold it there. Toward the end, you\u0027ll start to work hard and finish off with an all-out assault on the summit. Along the way, you\u0027ll find out how the local wool is processed, how a network of ancient towers protected the region, why one house is covered in flowers, and what happened to all the local brown bears.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/3778259865)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

Your bodies ability to clear out metabolites and process oxygen is nearly identical between 90% of FTP and 100% of FTP, the difference is that at 100% of FTP your body is producing those metabolites at the same rate it is clearing them. At 90% of FTP your body can clear things at the same rate, but your body isn\u0027t producing them at the same rate.\n\n\nLong Sub-Threshold efforts represent an effort that your body can just about handle (assuming you are properly fueled and not completely exhausted), clearing things out faster than they can accumulate. To really stress that clearance rate each of these Sub-Threshold efforts start with a 20-second effort well above FTP. By the time you settle into the Sub-Threshold effort, your body will be flooded with those metabolites that cause your legs and lungs to burn. However, since you are below FTP (clearing things out faster than you are producing them), the concentration of those metabolites will slowly drop over the course of the whole effort. Not only does this train your body to clear things faster, but it will also mentally prepare for the discomfort associated with efforts above FTP.\n\n\u200B\n\nFor this session, we are asking you to dance on that razor\u0027s edge of your FTP, ideally the side that allows you to complete the session. If your legs or lungs aren\u0027t feeling great, you are better off dropping the steady effort by 5% and keeping the starting effort at 100%.\nAnother component of this is settling into a good rhythm of breathing and pedaling. Everyone has a preferred cadence, and this is an instance where your preferred cadence supersedes the cadence targets onscreen. We want you dancing right on that edge of your comfort, and you can get much closer to that edge riding your preferred cadence.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up **\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 5.5 -- 85% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n6 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of Sets: 3\n\nRest between sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nInterval repeats per set: NA\n\n**Interval**\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 9.5 -- 180% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume **\n\n55 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down **\n\n4 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

          "description": "The goal of this workout is to help develop your baseline aerobic fitness. While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are just times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right!\n\n\u200B\n\nMost people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022 Truth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted. So what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like?\n\nFor 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70% is ok, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm and your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster. You will have to trust us on that one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions! Or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\nWarm-Up\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\nMain Effort\n\nNumber of Sets\n\n8.5\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set\n\n1\n\nInterval: 10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n\u200B\n\nExtra Volume\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\nCool Down\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

          "description": "The 3x25-minute sub-threshold workout is one of the most classic interval sessions out there, so prepare for a trip to the northern Painlands for this FTP-builder. The reason the 3x25 sub-threshold workout is so popular is that it is easy to follow, helps teach good pacing, and gives you a great threshold training stimulus.\n\n\u200B\n\nIn this case, you\u0027re looking at three, (roughly) 25-minute blocks at around 90% of your FTP, an effort we refer to as \u0022Sub-Threshold\u0022. Many refer to this intensity as \u0022Sweet-Spot\u0022, but we prefer Sub-Threshold, as the real key is to never let your power creep above your FTP. Staying just below threshold ensures that your effort remains at an intensity you know your body can handle but that is close to what would not be sustainable.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe only way you\u0027re going to make it through three of these efforts is if you pace yourself properly. Everyone feels just fine for the first 5 minutes of the first effort, and are often tempted to go harder. Don\u0027t be that person. More often than not, that person blows up spectacularly in the second interval, unable to finish the session. Or they have to ride that second interval at lower power, turning it into a Tempo session, which is not the goal.\n\n\u200B\n\nGetting a sense of how these efforts \u0022bite\u0022 towards the end is vital to learning how to pace yourself over longer steady-state efforts; whether that\u0027s a time trial, local climb, breakaway, triathlon, or even a good old fitness test. In each of those cases, the pacing is key. Learning how your perceived effort can steadily climb even though your power remains unchanged is critical to good pacing.\n\n\u200B\n\nSo how do you know if you are doing this one right? As we said, the first 5 minutes should feel relatively easy. Around that 5-minute mark, your heart rate should stop climbing, and settle into 2-5% below your Lactate Threshold Heart Rate (LTHR). If your heart rate is climbing for the entire effort and goes above your LTHR, then you are going too hard.\n\nIf you hit the 10-minute mark, your legs feel fine, and your heart rate is still in Zone 3, then you aren\u0027t going hard enough.\n\nIf you\u0027ve never done a session like this before, you can consider only doing the first 20-minute effort, or even sticking to just the first 15 minutes of each effort. There\u0027s no shame in building up to this full session, so don\u0027t be afraid to pause and fast forward as needed.\n\n\u200B\n\nNailing this session is really about getting in tune with your body and understanding what the edge between a sustainable and an unsustainable effort feels like. Not being able to complete this workout is fairly common, so don\u0027t beat yourself up if you can\u0027t make it through the first few times. As long as you come away from this session with a better understanding of how to pace longer efforts, you\u0027ve improved as an athlete.\n",

          "description": "While some of you will know this intensity level as \u0022Sweet-Spot\u0022, we prefer the name Sub-Threshold, because we want to drive home the fact that you should keep your power below FTP. In the same way that longer Tempo efforts can feel \u0022easy,\u0022 these shorter Sub-Threshold efforts can also feel \u0022easy\u0022. After all, if you can hold 100% of FTP for about an hour, then holding less than that for 5-minutes should be a piece of cake right? We know you can go harder for 5-minutes, but that is not what we are asking for.\n\n\nThis session is not intended to push you to your limits, nor is it designed to be a massive training load. The real purpose is to essentially keep your fatigue levels right where they are, by giving your body just enough intensity to ensure that you are not \u0022more recovered\u0022 after today.\n\n\nWhile some folks will say that there is no training benefit to such short Sub-Threshold efforts, when viewed in a bigger picture sense (like a 3-week training block) they can be the perfect efforts to ensure you get the most out of a longer training block.\n\n\nWe would even ask that you view this session as more of an assessment, rather than strictly a workout. That\u0027s because you should be comparing this power output to heart rate response and your own internal RPE. When you have heavy fatigue, your heart rate will struggle to hit its normal peaks. When fresh you would be getting into Z4 heart rate by the end of the last two intervals, and your RPE should never really climb above a 7. When holding onto excess fatigue, your heart rate won\u0027t climb above Z3, and your RPE will be above an 8. At the same time, if you have gained a significant amount of fitness, your Heart Rate will stay in Z3, and your RPE won\u0027t climb above 6. The secondary tell between improved fitness and fatigue is how quickly your heart rate drops after each effort. When fatigued, your heart rate won\u0027t drop below Z2 during the recovery.\n\n\nWhile it is easy to rely solely on Power, you should always refer back to RPE and Heart Rate, and today is the perfect session to practice comparing the 3.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-Up **\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%\n1 minute @ RPE 7 -- 90% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 8 -- 110% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: N/A\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 3\n\n**Interval **\n\nEffort: 25 minutes @ RPE 6.5 -- 87% of FTP -- HR \u003C95%\n\nRecovery: 15 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume **\n\n25 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C85%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down **\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 1 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are just times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right!\n\n\u200B\n\nMost people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022 Truth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted. So what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like?\n\nFor 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70% is ok, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm and your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster. You will have to trust us on that one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions! Or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\nWarm-Up\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\nMain Effort\n\nNumber of Sets\n\n8.5\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set\n\n1\n\nInterval: 10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n\u200B\n\nExtra Volume\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\nCool Down\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

          "description": "If you want a do-it-all session that will maintain and improve nearly every aspect of your fitness, _The Chores_ is just the ticket. This workout features 3 sets of intervals. Each set combines a series of 40-second efforts with 20-second recoveries, followed by an immediate transition to a sustained effort just below threshold. These short efforts with minimal recovery deplete your anaerobic gas tank, forcing your body to get better at producing power aerobically. This combination will help improve your Anaerobic Capacity, (AC) your Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP), and your Functional Threshold Power (FTP), all in just under an hour.\n\n\u200B\n\nAt the start of each set, your body starts to dip into your anaerobic reserves to help hit the high-power targets. Your body then starts to ramp up your oxygen intake in order to produce more of the power requirements aerobically. With such short recovery time between these efforts, your AC is steadily drained through each set. By the time the last short interval arrives, your body will be forced to produce almost all of that power aerobically, which will push your lungs to their very limit.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis is the optimal time to stress your body\u2019s ability to produce power at threshold. With your AC depleted (and your lungs and heart working near maximal capacity), the shorter sustained efforts that would normally be a piece of cake will have a bit more...sting. No matter what your preferred discipline, terrain, or distance, this session will make you fitter and faster.\n\n\u200B\n\nFeaturing exciting, on-bike camera footage from the Velon Hammer Series, _The Chores_ will make you earn your keep.\n",

Chelsea shares the power of finding her voice, advocating for female athletes, and why motherhood is her most significant victory to date. Follow Chelsea\u0027s journey to defending her World Champion title in 2023.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Heather Jackson:** As one chapter closes, a new one opens. After 15 years as a professional triathlete, Heather Jackson decided to challenge herself in new ways, build a fresh community, and push her own and other\u0027s expectations of what is humanly possible. In June, Heather tackled the Unbound Gravel 200, often hailed as the \u0022Super Bowl\u0022 of gravel bike racing, and the iconic Western States Endurance Run, the world\u2019s oldest 100-mile trail race. Facing these demanding events with just a two-week gap between them, the question looms: how will Heather approach her most ambitious goal yet?\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: This is a great way to watch a compelling documentary while developing your baseline aerobic fitness.

          "description": "Standing starts closely simulates a lifting session on the bike because it requires the engagement of your core, upper, and lower body. It trains your ability to generate force through the pedals by ensuring you recruit ALL of your muscles to get that crank turning. No matter your preferred discipline, these efforts are key to teaching your body to recruit all of the muscle fibers in your legs. The saying \u201CUse it or Lose it\u201D actually does apply here.\n\n\u200B\n\nAll of the benefits in this session come from hitting these 20-second efforts as hard as you possibly can. To do that, you need full recovery between each sprint, and you need to respect that recovery! These efforts should see you start at super low RPMs with very high torque. As you start and increase the effort, your cadence will naturally increase. Your goal is to get your cadence as high as possible by the end of each 20-second effort. To maximize your muscle recruitment, you want to both push down and pull up on the pedals at the start. Proper core engagement is a must - your legs need a good strong backboard to push against.\n\n\u200B\n\nWe understand that not everyone\u0027s trainer has the necessary resistance or the required stability to perform this workout as described. If you can\u0027t safely stand up, then you can get much of the same benefit by doing these efforts seated. If your trainer can\u2019t handle the rapid change in speed or does not have high enough resistance at a super low cadence, then you can start the efforts at a higher cadence and treat them as \u201Cnormal\u201D all-out sprints.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n3 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C 80%\n\n6 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: N/A\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 6\n\n**Interval **\n\nStanding Start: 20 seconds @ RPE 10 --\n\nStarting from standing (or very very very slow rolling) starts in a 53x14 gear.

While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high and your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week. Shorter Endurance rides (like this one) can fit in both a hard week of training and a recovery week. That is, only if you do it right! Most people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022\n\n\u200B\n\nTruth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride, especially one under 90 minutes should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted.\n\nSo what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like? For 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70%, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in low to mid Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can; for most this is 80-90rpm. Also, your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster, but you will have to trust us on this one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions, or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: 4\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nNA\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

The term \u0022Taper\u0022 refers to how you train in the week or so before your target event to ensure you deliver your best performance. Generally, tapering means reducing your total training volume but continuing to hit some high-intensity efforts. While there are individual variations in the best way to taper, this session has been used by countless professionals leading into the biggest races of their lives -- athletes like World Champions Rohan Dennis and Flora Duffy.\n\n\u200B\n\nWith 3 sets of micro-intervals (40/20s, 30/30s, and 20/40s) you will hit your system with just enough intensity to keep your legs sharp and responsive, without adding any real fatigue. Outside of those 3 sets of micro-intervals, this session is purposefully short and easy. This is a preparation session, not a training session! After all, your event is just around the corner and all of the important training is behind you. Riding harder or longer today will do absolutely nothing to increase your fitness by event day; in fact, all that would do is increase your fatigue, which will only hurt your performance. Rather, this session makes sure your body is humming along and ready to perform on the big day.\n",

          "description": "This is a technique-focused session designed to develop your agility, stability, range of motion, and foot speed. There is no focus on heart rate zones so you may choose to leave your monitor at home for these sessions. Between sets of each drill, you should jog/walk easily to fully recover between the efforts. While these efforts shouldn\u2019t be too taxing on you, the key is perfect form, so you want to be hitting each one rested enough that you can maintain great form for the duration. You should take a bit of extra rest between techniques, again to ensure you are rested and can nail the form. Before starting the workout, familiarize yourself with the format for high knees, butt kicks, skipping, carioca and strides. Find a flat track, field, or 50-100m of open space to perform this workout (football and soccer fields are great for this).\n\n\u200B\n\nFor help understanding your run workout and calculating your pace zones, please see [this article](https://wahoosystm.com/RunningSessionFAQ).\n\nLearn how to perform your [**Running Drills**](https://support.wahoofitness.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404080091922-Running-Drills) here.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-up:**\n\nStart off with 5-10 minutes of easy jogging/walking.\n\nHigh Knees: 2-3 sets of 50m high knees.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- Take short strides, bringing your knees up high enough that your upper legs are parallel to the ground. Focus on achieving high knees AND quick turnover, or performing as many reps as possible in a short distance.\n\n**Butt Kicks:**\n\n2-3 sets of 50m butt kicks.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- This should actually look similar to a high knee drill, but with the heels coming up to touch the bottom of your butt. Take short strides while using your hamstrings to lift your heels up beneath your butt. Your knees should come up in front of your body while pulling your heels up beneath your hips, rather than keeping your quads and knees below and in line with your hips.\n\n**Skipping:**\n\n3-4 sets of 50m skipping.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- Focus on a high knee drive and swinging your arms at your sides like you would when running.\n\n**Carioca:**\n\n4 sets of 30m Carioca in each direction (8 total).\n\nRest for 20 seconds between direction changes (at your discretion).\n\n- For this drill, you need to face sidewise to the direction you want to go. Start off moving to the right. Bring your left knee up and across your body and put your left foot in front of your right foot. Step your right foot to the right so it is parallel with your left leg again (at this point you should be positioned in the same direction and orientation that you were at the start. Next step your left leg behind your right leg, again so it lands on the right side of your right leg. Then bring your right leg back across your body, once again ending up in the starting position. Repeat this pattern for 25-30m.\n\n**Strides:**\n\n2-3 sets of 60m; Gradually build effort from RPE 3-8.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between. These are comprised of a steady acceleration over 60-80m up to 5k pace. The goal is to increase speed after each step, so you are reaching maximum speed at the end of the 60-80m stretch. You want to focus on keeping your shoulders, neck, and jaw relaxed while maintaining strong knee drive, straight and compact arm swing, planting the feet beneath the hips, and fast turnover.\n\n\u200B\n\nHigh Knees \u002B Butt Kicks:\n\nFinish these drills with one set each of 50m high knees and butt kicks.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool-down:**\n\nWalk or jog for 5 minutes to cool down.\n\nIn case you need to brush up on your running [drills](https://wahoosystm.com/RunningSessionFAQ)\n",
