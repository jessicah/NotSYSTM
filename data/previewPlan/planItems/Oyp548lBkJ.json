Click [\u002B\u002Bhere\u002B\u002B](https://wahoox.forum.wahoofitness.com/t/wahoo-november-challenge-groundwork/30430) to find out more.\n\n\u200B\n\nWouldn\u0027t it be great if you could leave work to go for a ride? Even for an hour? Well, now\u0027s your chance. _Getting Away With It_ gets you out of the office and onto the roads of the French Pyrenees with your guide Michael Cotty of The Col Collective.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis is a great session to add toward the end of a training block. The shorter duration, sub-threshold efforts are fantastic for getting some extra FTP building while you are in a fatigued state. Extra emphasis on cadence stresses your nervous system, making your body more efficient at higher and lower RPMs while improving your form. The Neuromuscular training you get from this session is fantastic, so while your power never exceeds threshold, your body will learn to bring more energy to the pedals at all intensities.\n",

While it\u0027s not as comprehensive or as accurate as our main fitness test, _Full Frontal_, it\u0027s far more approachable and easier to pace for new riders. It also doesn\u0027t require any special preparation. You just need to feel relatively fresh.\n\n\u200B\n\nBased on more than a year of research (and after dozens of lab tests and thousands of online tests) and using sophisticated analysis of power and heart rate data, _Half Monty_ is far more accurate and comprehensive than standard ramp tests.\n\n\u200B\n\nIt also tells you more about who you are as an athlete. _Half Monty_ provides you with your FTP, Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP), and Cycling Threshold Heart Rate (cTHR), all of which we use to personalize your workout targets.\n\n\u200B\n\nIf you\u0027re still using the 4DP estimates when you set up your account, _Half Monty_ will also refine your AC and NM estimates (but will not do so if you\u0027ve done _Full Frontal_ or manually adjusted your estimates). If you want fully accurate AC and NM, as well as your Rider Type, Strengths, Weaknesses, and training plans adjusted to those Strengths and Weaknesses, you\u0027ll need to expose yourself to the _Full Frontal_ 4DP fitness test.\n\n\u200B\n\nReady to climb the ramp? You\u0027ll need the following before you start:\n\n- A heart rate monitor if you want the most accurate results. Don\u0027t have one? Order one [HERE](https://wahoofitness.com/devices)\n- Some kind of power device connected (trainer, power meter, virtual power, etc.)\n- Be ready to pay close attention to the instructions in the workout\n- Be sure your profile is complete and up-to-date (Profile \u003E About You). Accurate information helps us make our calculations\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to \u0027[Why Fitness Testing Matters](https://the-knowledge-by-wahoo-sports-science.simplecast.com/episodes/testing-testing-1-2-3-why-fitness-testing-matters)\u0027 on The Knowledge Podcast by Wahoo Sports Science.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s some more information on how to get the most from your fitness test.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterFitnessAssessment)\n",

This one may be short but it\u2019ll have you hanging onto the edge of your saddle as we explore the Pilancones Natural Park, high up on a mountain ridge overlooking the Soria valley as we head towards Chira Lake. The goal of this ride will be to work on your good form with a slightly higher cadence than normal, keeping the legs supple and spinning. We\u2019ll gently build the effort up a 3km climb to get the heart, legs and lungs working a little harder before descending to our final destination at Chira Lake. This workout is perfect for those days when you need an easier session or want to activate the body before going deeper.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis workout focusses on a progressive build through the duration of the climb helping with your pacing skills and sustained efforts.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/8773915186)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

          "description": "This session is all about Max Aerobic Power (MAP), also known as VO2 max training. MAP refers to the maximum rate of oxygen delivery and uptake by your body and is an important metric in the world of endurance sports. During this 30-minute session, you\u2019ll be doing five MAP targeted intervals. The first is 3 minutes long, and each successive interval gets 30 seconds shorter until you end with a final effort of \u201Cjust\u201D 60 seconds. The structure of each interval varies to keep you on your toes, some with increases in power, some with decreases.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe cadence targets for this session are generally going to be a little higher than \u201Ccomfortable\u201D for most people \u2013 and for a very specific reason. We want to maximize the cardiovascular stress of this session rather than loading up your muscular system. But don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll still feel it in your muscles \u2013 likely all of them.\n\n\u200B\n\nTo keep the total stress of this shorter session fairly high, you\u2019re going to have _just enough_ recovery between each effort, but nothing extra \u2013 so don\u2019t let the short duration fool you into thinking this is going to be easy. On the contrary, you might find this to be one of the more challenging\u2014and productive\u2014sessions in our library. Now, go out there and get that stage win!\n",

          "description": "Starting at the islands iconic rainbow rocks at Los Azulejos de Veneguera in this session we tackle one of the most stunning climbs on the whole island, known locally as \u201CSerenity\u201D. We\u2019ll be breaking this 10km climb down into three distinct sections, kicking off with a block of 6 x 50 second high tempo efforts with a 10 second burst out of the saddle before taking a swift breather before getting back on it. As we climb through the pine forest we\u2019ll switch things up a touch, alternating between low and high cadence for 30 seconds at a time for around 7 minutes. We\u2019ll then revert back to our 50 second high tempo with 10 second burst out of the saddle efforts before we build up our effort to the summit. This is going to be a challenging workout so make sure you\u2019re ready and whatever you do don\u2019t forget to take a moment to look at the views!!\n\n\u200B\n\nThis workout combines multiple different interval types that focus on improving threshold power via over-under style efforts along with low cadence work for your muscular endurance. The first and last climbs also fire up your whole energy systems with some sprints to the summit.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/8735613403)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty. As founder of The Col Collective, Mike has made a career out of riding, filming, and telling the story of epic rides and mountains across the continent. As your On Location co-creator and host, Mike\u0027s engaging character, curious mind, and friendly nature will have you cueing up your next ride with him before you\u0027ve even finished the cool-down._\n",

The shorter, super-high intensity efforts also help with your Neuromuscular Power (NM). The second set features inverse intervals with opposite efforts and recoveries. This really depletes your body\u0027s AC, so you need to rely on your aerobic system. This helps develop your Maximal Aerobic Power.\n",

          "description": "While you\u0027re certainly going to feel this workout in your legs, it\u0027s what happens in your head over these six intervals that matter most. A sort of \u0027Applied Mental Training Program\u0027 session is a unique addition to the SUF library.\n\n\u200B\n\nOver the course of the workout, you\u0027ll be taken through six different mental toughness tasks drawn from the SYSTM Mental Training Program (available here in the app). We\u0027ll teach you how to focus, use positive self-talk, and see an image of Future You to help you push through the Suffering.\n\n\u200B\n\nFrom a physical point of view, this is a series of five-minute intervals with very high Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) efforts at both ends. They pack the same training punch as much longer Sub-Threshold efforts with the added bonus of stimulating your MAP and Anaerobic Capacity (AC) simultaneously.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Physiologically**: The first 30-second effort digs you into an anaerobic hole. Even though it is a MAP-based target, your heart rate and breathing rates (and thus ability to deliver oxygen) are still low, so your body must produce much of this power anaerobically. By the time you settle into the 4-minutes at just below FTP, your body will have produced an excess of metabolites responsible for that burning in your legs. Only by riding below FTP will your body clear them out since FTP is the tipping point where your body produces metabolites at the same rate it is clearing them. By holding you at FTP, your body cannot clear out that excess, forcing you to deal with the associated discomfort for the next 4-minutes.\n\nCapping the effort off with a final 30-second surge requires that you dig into what is left of your AC while your body pushes you close to your VO2 max, or the point at which your body is using as much oxygen as it possibly can. The net result is a session that is great for improving FTP, MAP, and AC, regardless of your strengths and weaknesses.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Psychologically**: Each 4-minute segment at just below FTP will end up feeling harder than it should, given your body is forced to stew in whatever excess metabolites you produced in the first 30-seconds. While it will be unpleasant, you should find it never really gets MORE unpleasant. In addition to the benefits from the actual mental training exercises, this preps you to have confidence in your ability to hold longer sustained FTP efforts. The final surge then shows you that even when you feel uncomfortable for that long, your body still has something more to give. Going through the Mental Training techniques while you\u0027re pushing through the discomfort will only make you stronger out on the road.\n\n\u200B\n\nIn some cultures, the bat symbolizes the death of old ways and the rise of new ones. Time to burn those old, bad habits and build some new, positive ones.\n",
