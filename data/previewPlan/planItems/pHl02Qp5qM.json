There is a reason this simple session has stuck around: it works.\n\n\u200B\n\n30 seconds into a high-intensity effort, enough of your anaerobic energy sources have been depleted that your body shifts to producing that power aerobically. Follow that effort with only 60 seconds of recovery, and your body hasn\u2019t fully replenished those anaerobic stores, meaning it will have to produce that power aerobically after just 25 seconds.\n\n\u200B\n\nWith a total of just 15 (cough, cough) efforts, you will have not only forced your body to replenish its Anaerobic Capacity (AC) over and over, but you\u0027ve just spent several minutes producing lots of power with lots of oxygen. That combination ensures this session hits both your Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) and AC with just the right stress they need to start increasing.\n\n\u200B\n\n_Revolver has recently been remastered (Aug \u002722) to include all new footage and music. The workout has a longer warm-up than previous editions._\n",

After a big year of success in Season 3 at the Leadville Trail 100, Season 4 sees a new group of riders reaching for gravel bikes as the race of focus becomes SBT GRVL in Steamboat Springs, CO. In the first of five episodes, the riders meet in Memphis, TN at Victory Bicycle Studio, a local business that is helping the riders find the best bike for them to find success! Follow along and get ready to binge the entire season right now!\n\n\u200B\n\n**Episode 2: Age Is Just A Number**\n\nIn episode 2 we arrive in Bentonville for arguably the MOST important stop on our journey to SBT GRVL, skills. After receiving their bikes in Memphis, TN - Victory Bicycle Studio got them all ready and shipped them to Arkansas to be reunited. In this episode we hear from Rich about why he chose to take on something as daunting as FTGU as well as learn valuable skills with The Ride Series team and 15 of our closest FTGU friends.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Episode 3: Redefining Limits**\n\nIn episode 3 we see our team begin to understand what it will take to finish SBT GRVL. We visit Gunnison, CO for a riding camp to push the limits 6 weeks out from race day. Our goal is to ride the distance and ascent of the race over two days at altitude and see what people struggle with. We also check in with Lou and his path to FTGU. Lou has big goals and finding balance in life and sport is key!\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: This is a great way to watch a compelling documentary while developing your baseline aerobic fitness. The intensity of this workout will vary mostly between 60-70% of FTP, with heart rate remaining entirely in zone 2. This session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s how to turn off on-screen graphics for the best viewing experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterInspiration)\n",

For just over 50 minutes, you\u0027ll tackle five different 6-minute long, progressive efforts that start just below FTP and finish well above it for the final minute.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe real challenge of this workout is the limited 1-minute recovery sections between each effort. You\u2019ll want to savor every second of those short recoveries. This workout will help improve your FTP and improve your ability to recover while pushing just under your threshold for the first half of each effort. You\u2019ll also learn to manage your pacing and put out power above your threshold after holding steady just below that breakpoint.\n\n\u200B\n\nRiders with sustained weakness will benefit greatly from this workout, as will anyone looking to push up their FTP.\n\n_Attacker_ is quite similar to the SUF workout, _Defender._ However, the efforts within each interval are 2-minutes shorter, and instead of starting harder and backing off like in _Defender,_ the efforts in this session start controlled and keep squeezing harder and harder until the end.\n",

As the first in this MAP progression series you have 2 sets of 8 intervals that are 30 seconds long with 15 seconds of recovery in between.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis workout is a great intro into higher intensity sessions and should get your heart rate up but not overload you.\n\nHow will this session progress with future NoVids? Each new session will add more repeats, or more sets or both.

Each person will battle their own self doubt as the gun goes off for the final time this season.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: This is a great way to watch a compelling documentary while developing your baseline aerobic fitness. The intensity of this workout will vary mostly between 60-70% of FTP, with heart rate remaining entirely in zone 2.

In simple terms, this session is a classic tabata style workout where the \u0027work\u0027 interval is twice the length of the \u0027recovery\u0027 intervals. As the second in this MAP progression series you have 2 sets of 11 intervals that are 30 seconds long with 15 seconds of recovery in between.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis workout is a great intro into higher intensity sessions and should get your heart rate up but not overload you.\n\nHow will this session progress with future NoVids? Each new session will add more repeats, or more sets or both. By the 5th level you\u0027ll be up to 3 sets of 14 repeats.\n\n\u200B\n\nFind out more about how to apply these sessions to your training [here](https://wahoox.forum.wahoofitness.com/t/new-novids-in-systm/22251).\n",

          "description": "You can never have too many tools in the shed. After years of lobbying, we finally convinced Grunter von Agony to share his favorite set of implements with us: the fabled _14 Vise Grips_. Taken individually, each of the 14 intervals might appear tame, incapable of inflicting a significant squeeze. But when expertly applied in the correct order, they apply just the right kind of pressure to turn a Couchlandrian into a Sufferlandrian, just like turning coal into diamonds.\n\n\u200B\n\nWhile the duration of each Vise Grip varies (from 30 seconds to 2 minutes), the power targets and recovery durations between them remain constant. The first 30-second interval should feel like a Sunday stroll in the park, but by the end of the first 2-minute Vise Grip, you\u0027ll be cursing Grunter\u0027s name. As the intervals get shorter, time will appear to stretch. That final 30-second effort will feel like an eternity. When you roll up to the second set, you\u0027ll know what you\u0027re in for, so just put your head down and prepare yourself to crush or be crushed.\n\n\u200B\n\nOnce you make it through all 14 Vise Grips, you will have been north of your Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) for a total of 16 minutes. Changing the duration of the efforts (while keeping the same recovery) stresses your Anaerobic Capacity (AC) in a more dynamic way than, say, a more straightforward on/off session like _Half is Easy_. Since the longer efforts have the same recovery duration as the shorter ones, you will eventually deplete your AC, forcing your body to rely on your MAP to hit the required power targets. As the intervals get shorter in the second half of each set, you\u0027ll find that you have just enough left in the tank to complete the next effort.\n\n\u200B\n\nUltimately this workout combines the advantages of shorter, higher-power intervals with longer recovery (great for building muscular strength) with the advantages of longer, higher-power intervals with inadequate recovery (great for driving up your MAP and improving your AC).\n",

          "description": "One of the best sessions for neuromuscular training, this drill asks you to progressively build from a cadence of 90 RPM to your MAX over 30 seconds, recover, and repeat several times. Cadence builds improve how you recruit your leg, gluteal, and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke by progressing to your maximal cadence. By reaching your highest cadence possible, you are training the \u0027on/off\u0027 switch in each muscle group to not only work faster but to have less overlap with your other muscle groups. This session trains your hamstring muscles to \u0027turn off\u0027 when your quads \u0027turn on\u0027 and vice-versa, resulting in a more efficient pedal stroke at both high and low cadences.\n\n\u200B\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to The Knowledge podcast, by Wahoo Sports Science - The Benefits of High Cadence Training: [https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence](https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence)\n",
