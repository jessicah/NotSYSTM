          "description": "This skills session is designed to mimic a variety of challenging course conditions and scenarios you will encounter on race day. The skills practiced here are done below race pace so you can focus on proper execution. To properly complete this ride you will need to find a field with the following features and bring along some equipment:  \n  \nA set of stairs, ideally with enough area at the top to practice re-mounting your bike.  \nA flat, open area to practice Figure 8s. Use water bottles or cones to mark the corners.  \nA hill to practice off-camber riding.  \nBarriers about shin high, which can be made from PVC pipe or improvised using your imagination (and a few water bottles).  \n  \nHere\u2019s how to tackle this session:  \n  \nWarm-up for 10-15 minutes Z1/Z2 spinning, include 2 x 1 minute Z3 efforts to warm up.  \n  \nStairs. Complete 3-4 sets:  \nApproach the stairs at a decent speed (but don\u2019t go over a Z3 effort).  \nDismount and focus on the technique needed to maintain your momentum up the stairs. Experiment with both the timing of your dismount and how you hold your bike while running up the stairs. You may wish to sling it over your shoulder or pick it up by the top tube and handlebars.  \nAt the top remount as smoothly as possible while trying to maintain your forward momentum.  \n  \nFigure 8s. Complete 5-10 minutes:  \nFor more info on Figure 8s read \u201CTips for Figure 8s\u201D.  \nSet up two bottles or cones roughly 20m apart and practice your Figure 8s.  \nFocus on maintaining your speed, and try to avoid accelerating or surging out of the \u201Cturns\u201D.  \nIf you\u2019re feeling frisky you can break up the Figure 8s with 50-75m Field Runs every couple minutes.  \n  \nBarriers. Complete 4-8 sets:  \nNext, set up some barriers (you can make a portable set from PVC pipe, or you can use some water bottles and your imagination).  \nHit your barrer section at a decent speed (again trying to avoid going over Z3).  \nPractice and perfect the timing of your dismount and remount. The key here is keeping your leg speed quick and nimble between the barriers!  \n  \nOff-Camber Riding. Complete 5-10 minutes:  \nRide to the top of the hill and then ride along the length of the crest. Try to hold a straight line while not gaining or losing elevation.  \nTurn around and ride it in the opposite direction.  \nAs your off-camber skills develop you can try riding faster and faster to see where your limit is, and sometimes that means going over it! Be safe, but remember that you won\u2019t know what you can and can\u2019t do until you try!  \n  \nFinish with 5-10 minutes of easy spinning to cool down.  \n  \n**Warm-Up  \n**8 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%  \n1 minutes @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%  \n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%  \n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C 80%  \n4 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%  \n  \n**Main Effort  \n**Number of Sets: 4  \nRest Between Sets: 2 minutes  \nInterval Repeats per Set: 1  \n**Interval  \n**8 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70% focusing on assigned skill  \n2 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%  \n  \n**Extra Volume  \n**N/A  \n  \n**Cool Down  \n**5 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%  \n",

The skills practiced here are done at race pace so you can focus on proper execution while under pressure. To properly complete this ride you will need to find a field with the following features and bring along some equipment:  \n  \n- A set of stairs, ideally with enough area at the top to practice re-mounting your bike.  \n- A flat, open area to practice Figure 8s. Use water bottles or cones to mark the corners.  \n- A hill to practice off-camber riding.  \n- Barriers about shin high, which can be made from PVC pipe or improvised using your imagination (and a few water bottles).  \n- BONUS: an area with sand or deep and loose dirt.  \n  \nHere\u2019s how to tackle this session:  \n  \nWarm-up for 10-15 minutes Z1/Z2 spinning, include two 3-5 second hard accelerations.  \n  \nHole Shot \u002B Stairs. Complete 2 sets:  \nSimulate your race start by lining up 300-400m away from the stairs, in your starting gear and with one foot unclipped.  \nCountdown from 10 and you\u2019re OFF! Clip in and complete an all out 15 second effort.  \nWork on shifting up smoothly during the effort as you would in a race.  \nContinue the effort around Z3/Z4 effort for 60 seconds while riding towards the base of the stairs.  \nDismount and run up the stairs and remount at the top.  \nBetween the first and second set, do 50-100m of Field Running.  \n  \nBarriers. Complete 4-6 sets:  \nSet up some barriers (you can make a portable set from PVC pipe, or you can use some water bottles and your imagination).  \nStarting about 100m out from your barriers, speed towards the barriers at race pace.  \nThe challenge is to focus on the timing of your dismount and remount and to keep you leg speed high between the barriers in order to maintain the most momentum.  \n  \nFigure 8s. Complete 5-10 minutes:  \nFor more info on Figure 8s read \u201CTips for Figure 8s\u201D.  \nSet up 2 bottles about 30m apart and practice your Figure 8s.  \nTo simulate a race scenario, drive your first 3-4 pedal strokes super hard coming out of each \u201Cturn\u201D.  \nAlternate seated efforts and standing efforts and experiment with your gearing to find the best fit for your desired cadence and power.  \n  \nSand Pit. Complete 5-10 minutes:  \nIf you also have access to a sand pit then finish with 4-6 efforts through the sand. See \u201CTips For Sand\u201D to master this skill.  \nFinish with 5-10 minutes of easy spinning to cool down.  \n  \n**Warm-Up **8 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%  \n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%  \n1 minutes @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%  \n10 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 150% of FTP -- HR \u003C 100%  \n50 seconds @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C 70%  \n10 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 150% of FTP -- HR \u003C 100%  \n4 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%  \n  \n**Main Effort **  \nNumber of Sets: 4  \nRest Between Sets: 2 minutes  \nInterval Repeats per Set: 1  \n**Interval**  \n8 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70% focusing on assigned skill  \n2 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%  \n  \n**Extra volume **  \nN/A  \n  \n**Cool Down **  \n5 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%  \n",

A recovery spin is a very low intensity ride, so easy that you\u2019d feel embarrassed to ride so slowly if you didn\u2019t know you were helping your body get so much faster.\n\n\u200B\n\nA good recovery spin is done at a cadence above 90 RPM. While keeping power below 50% of FTP, or an RPE less than 2.5, and keeping your heart rate in Zone 1 the entire time. Recovery spins can be done outdoors, but due to the low power demands, they are often easier done on the trainer. Resist the voice of your inner Sufferlandrian telling you to go faster.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Set**\n\n30 minute @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR \u003C70%\n",

The term \u0022Taper\u0022 refers to how you train in the week or so before your target event to ensure you deliver your best performance. Generally, tapering means reducing your total training volume but continuing to hit some high-intensity efforts. While there are individual variations in the best way to taper, this session has been used by countless professionals leading into the biggest races of their lives -- athletes like World Champions Rohan Dennis and Flora Duffy.\n\n\u200B\n\nWith 3 sets of micro-intervals (40/20s, 30/30s, and 20/40s) you will hit your system with just enough intensity to keep your legs sharp and responsive, without adding any real fatigue. Outside of those 3 sets of micro-intervals, this session is purposefully short and easy. This is a preparation session, not a training session! After all, your event is just around the corner and all of the important training is behind you. Riding harder or longer today will do absolutely nothing to increase your fitness by event day; in fact, all that would do is increase your fatigue, which will only hurt your performance. Rather, this session makes sure your body is humming along and ready to perform on the big day.\n",
