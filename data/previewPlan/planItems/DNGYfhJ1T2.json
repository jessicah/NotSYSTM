Even for an hour? Well, now\u0027s your chance. _Getting Away With It_ gets you out of the office and onto the roads of the French Pyrenees with your guide Michael Cotty of The Col Collective.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis is a great session to add toward the end of a training block. The shorter duration, sub-threshold efforts are fantastic for getting some extra FTP building while you are in a fatigued state. Extra emphasis on cadence stresses your nervous system, making your body more efficient at higher and lower RPMs while improving your form. The Neuromuscular training you get from this session is fantastic, so while your power never exceeds threshold, your body will learn to bring more energy to the pedals at all intensities.\n",

But there is more here than the power file shows. The lack of obvious intensity in these short intervals is made up for by the very low cadence targets each effort requires. This creates minimal cardiovascular stress but places a tremendous load on your muscular system. The goal is to keep your upper body absolutely rock solid during these efforts. If you find that you bob back and forth for each pedal stroke, then your core is not up to the task your legs are giving it (better get onto our yoga videos and strengthen that core).\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session can be a great test to see how your lower back will hold up over a longer ride outside. A core that will fail you after 3 hours of road riding can often be identified fairly quickly during this session. If your back is burning just as badly as your legs, it\u0027s a signal to do some additional core strengthening. With so much stress on your muscles, this is a great session for improving your overall endurance and your ability to produce lots of high torque, giving your Neuromuscular Power a nice boost along the way.\n\n\u200B\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to \u0027[When to Train with Low Cadence](https://the-knowledge-by-wahoo-sports-science.simplecast.com/episodes/when-to-train-with-low-cadence)\u0027 on The Knowledge Podcast by Wahoo Sports Science.\n",

As you savor the efforts (and meals) of the day, you and Phil will sit down and reflect on the week: what you learned, what you accomplished, and what to do next to showcase your newfound skills.\n\n\u200B\n\n_Do this on: Day 5 of the 5-day plan._\n",
