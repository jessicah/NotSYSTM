It had provided them with the adventure of a lifetime; from a sense of what it would be like to ride in the fabled Tour de France that he has reported on more than 30 times, to the creation of friendships with fellow riders forged by their shared suffering and encouragement for one another as they cycled through some of the toughest and most spectacular mountains that cycling has to offer.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: This is a great way to watch a compelling documentary while developing your baseline aerobic fitness.

Cadence builds improve how you recruit your leg, gluteal, and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke by progressing to your maximal cadence. By reaching your highest cadence possible, you are training the \u0027on/off\u0027 switch in each muscle group to not only work faster but to have less overlap with your other muscle groups. This session trains your hamstring muscles to \u0027turn off\u0027 when your quads \u0027turn on\u0027 and vice-versa, resulting in a more efficient pedal stroke at both high and low cadences.\n\n\u200B\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to The Knowledge podcast, by Wahoo Sports Science - The Benefits of High Cadence Training: [https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence](https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence)\n",

While it\u0027s not as comprehensive or as accurate as our main fitness test, _Full Frontal_, it\u0027s far more approachable and easier to pace for new riders. It also doesn\u0027t require any special preparation. You just need to feel relatively fresh.\n\n\u200B\n\nBased on more than a year of research (and after dozens of lab tests and thousands of online tests) and using sophisticated analysis of power and heart rate data, _Half Monty_ is far more accurate and comprehensive than standard ramp tests.\n\n\u200B\n\nIt also tells you more about who you are as an athlete. _Half Monty_ provides you with your FTP, Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP), and Cycling Threshold Heart Rate (cTHR), all of which we use to personalize your workout targets.\n\n\u200B\n\nIf you\u0027re still using the 4DP estimates when you set up your account, _Half Monty_ will also refine your AC and NM estimates (but will not do so if you\u0027ve done _Full Frontal_ or manually adjusted your estimates). If you want fully accurate AC and NM, as well as your Rider Type, Strengths, Weaknesses, and training plans adjusted to those Strengths and Weaknesses, you\u0027ll need to expose yourself to the _Full Frontal_ 4DP fitness test.\n\n\u200B\n\nReady to climb the ramp? You\u0027ll need the following before you start:\n\n- A heart rate monitor if you want the most accurate results. Don\u0027t have one? Order one [HERE](https://wahoofitness.com/devices)\n- Some kind of power device connected (trainer, power meter, virtual power, etc.)\n- Be ready to pay close attention to the instructions in the workout\n- Be sure your profile is complete and up-to-date (Profile \u003E About You). Accurate information helps us make our calculations\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to \u0027[Why Fitness Testing Matters](https://the-knowledge-by-wahoo-sports-science.simplecast.com/episodes/testing-testing-1-2-3-why-fitness-testing-matters)\u0027 on The Knowledge Podcast by Wahoo Sports Science.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s some more information on how to get the most from your fitness test.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterFitnessAssessment)\n",

Developed by Head of Wahoo Sports Science Coach Neal Henderson, Full Frontal uses the same lab-verified testing protocol that Coach Neal has used at the highest level for over a decade with professional and amateur athletes.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis test will provide you with a complete Four-Dimensional Power profile, identify your Rider Type, and tell you exactly what aspects of your fitness you need to focus on to become a more complete cyclist. More importantly, SYSTM will then use your results to set personalized power targets for all of your workouts based on your unique profile, resulting in the most precise, effective workouts available. Your results will also be used to tailor all of your training plans.\n\n\u200B\n\nWe recommend re-testing with Full Frontal every 8-12 weeks or as prescribed by your training plan.\n\n\u200B\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to \u0027[Why Fitness Testing Matters](https://the-knowledge-by-wahoo-sports-science.simplecast.com/episodes/testing-testing-1-2-3-why-fitness-testing-matters)\u0027 on The Knowledge Podcast by Wahoo Sports Science\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s some more information on how to get the most from your fitness test.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterFitnessAssessment)\n",

With a substantial progression, there\u2019s enough here to keep you busy -- and improving -- for a very long time._\n\n\u200B\n\nThis is the first routine in the Full Body series. It introduces the most basic versions of moves that make up the majority of this program. Some of these moves may seem very basic but we encourage you to focus on perfect form and execution during these early levels so that when we turn up the heat you have things nailed. As you\u0027ll see, all the exercises at the lower levels will progress in a similar fashion going forward. We\u0027re building strength, but also fine-tuning your nervous system. As the program progresses you\u0027ll be asked to complete more difficult variations on each foundational move.\n\n\u200B\n\nAs with all the strength training routines, it helps if you\u2019ve done a warm-up before getting started. That can be one of your favorite yoga routines, riding your bike on the trainer for 5-10 minutes, or doing a personal stretching routine.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?
