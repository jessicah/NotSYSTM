So nicely, in fact, that you\u2019re ready for a more demanding session. This workout includes compound sets which are more difficult but, most importantly, more beneficial than simply doing more sets of a single move. This is because your nervous system has to work overtime to cope with the variety. The number of reps per set is also higher, which will help drive continuous improvement.\n\n\u200B\n\nSince this is a longer session, you may experience considerable fatigue on your first time through. As a result, pay more attention to your form. Your body will want to use as little energy as possible, which can lead to some bad habits when hitting rep after rep of a single move.

You might see these sessions as too short and too easy to be beneficial, but just like a proper recovery spin, active recovery is infinitely better than doing nothing at all. Given how short this session is, we strongly recommend also doing a Yoga Session in the app first. Something like Mobilize and Activate, Balance and Agility, or Full Body Mobilization.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Exercises Included**\n\n- Kneeling Hip Drive with Hands Up\n- Kneeling Hip Drive with Hands to Side\n- High Plank\n- Plank\n- Hip Bridge\n- Bent Leg Tip at the Hip\n- Standing Hip Drive with Hands Up\n- Standing Hip Drive with Hands to Side\n",
