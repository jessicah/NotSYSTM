Each 8-minute set gives you more than five minutes at 90% or higher of your 5-minute peak power. By the end, you\u0027re looking at 16 minutes of accumulated MAP efforts, so get ready to say \u0027Hello, Pain!\u0027\n\nAlong the way, we\u0027ll give you some interesting mental tips on how to prepare for, and better manage, the discomfort (to put it mildly) that comes with such intense efforts.

The constant surging below, at, and well above threshold push your ability to recover to the max, making this a fantastic session for building your Anaerobic Capacity (AC). Since you are often forced to \u201Crecover\u201D at high intensities, your cardiovascular system hardly gets a real break, which means your Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) gets pushed hard too. With each effort ending in an all-out sprint, you really get to test out how much you have left in the tank. You might surprise yourself.\n",

Add in the standing starts for the Individual Pursuit and Kilo, and you give your NM a real run-through. The repeated surges of the Elimination Race, the all-out nature of the Kilo, and the massive efforts you have to make in the points race really test your powers of recovery while working your AC all the way to the max.\n\n\u200B\n\nSince the efforts come in quick succession, and with most being over four minutes in length, your cardiovascular system never catches a real break, ensuring your MAP doesn\u2019t get left out of the equation.\n",

But there is more here than the power file shows. The lack of obvious intensity in these short intervals is made up for by the very low cadence targets each effort requires. This creates minimal cardiovascular stress but places a tremendous load on your muscular system. The goal is to keep your upper body absolutely rock solid during these efforts. If you find that you bob back and forth for each pedal stroke, then your core is not up to the task your legs are giving it (better get onto our yoga videos and strengthen that core).\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session can be a great test to see how your lower back will hold up over a longer ride outside. A core that will fail you after 3 hours of road riding can often be identified fairly quickly during this session. If your back is burning just as badly as your legs, it\u0027s a signal to do some additional core strengthening. With so much stress on your muscles, this is a great session for improving your overall endurance and your ability to produce lots of high torque, giving your Neuromuscular Power a nice boost along the way.\n\n\u200B\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to \u0027[When to Train with Low Cadence](https://the-knowledge-by-wahoo-sports-science.simplecast.com/episodes/when-to-train-with-low-cadence)\u0027 on The Knowledge Podcast by Wahoo Sports Science.\n",

You do a quick sprint to go after them and quickly get their wheel. The stress of the effort catches up with you, and even though the pace settles down to where it was before, you struggle to hold the wheels.\n\n\u200B\n\nWho Dares is a workout that teaches your body to recover from those efforts more effectively so you can keep riding hard. The workout is based on three 9.5-minute, sub-FTP intervals that feature three sprints: one at the start, one in the middle, and one at the end. These sprints flood your body with metabolites like lactate, then the sustained sub-FTP efforts force your body to clear them out while still working hard.\n\n\u200B\n\nTo make the session even more effective, Who Dares also asks your body to do this work at different cadences, stimulating the nervous system and forcing your body to become even more efficient.\n",

          "description": "Here it is, a very long sustained effort session unlike any other in The Sufferfest library. Longer sustained efforts like this are crucial for improving your threshold. And while most of the climb is actually at tempo and sub-threshold effort, there are enough surges above it that your body will constantly be responding to them to clear out those nasty metabolites. Painsuckers, rejoice!\n\n\u200B\n\nContrary to popular belief, there are greater improvements that can be made in your FTP by working below FTP than there are in working above it. Also, during such a long effort with limited recovery the seemingly lower intensity is actually quite challenging. That\u2019s one of the reasons why the same power target five minutes into this climb feels much harder when it comes again at minute 30. This is a great session to help you work on your ability to maintain concentration and form even when fatigued\u2026so load this one up and climb your way to greater fitness and performance!\n",

          "description": "A SUF classic, this session is not for the faint of heart, or the fatigued of legs. What it may lack in polish it more than makes up for with results. With large continuous blocks above threshold, and the only \u201Crecovery\u201D coming in the form of tempo efforts (but only after massive surges), you need to bring your A-game to make it through this one. Actually, bring your A\u002B game.\n\n\u200B\n\nWith so much time right at or above threshold you really push your ability to efficiently produce aerobic power to its limits, which is the key to a quality FTP session (when you are fresh). All that time above threshold, those large surges, and that inadequate recovery also punishes your Anaerobic Capacity (AC) and Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) harder than other FTP-focused sessions.\n",
