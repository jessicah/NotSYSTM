Depending on your own individual needs, goals, and experiences, you may want to add additional activities to your plan and it is ok to do so. However, we encourage you to add strength, skills, drills and low intensity endurance sessions rather than any additional high intensity sessions. We also encourage you to be mindful of your progression and any additional volume that you might add. Pay attention to your body and be sure to get adequate recovery when needed.\n",

The pain will come.\n\n\u200B\n\nDuring each interval, you\u0027ll be ducking and diving right under and over threshold, forcing your body to churn through all the metabolites you\u0027re producing (that\u0027s the nasty stuff that the Painsuckers love so much). This is one of the best ways to improve your FTP without really overloading your system with too much training stress.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe final two intervals allow you to really charge over your threshold to unleash whatever power you have left in your legs. These two all-out bursts of power, in addition to the constant surges above threshold, means this session works your Anaerobic Capacity more than some of the other FTP-focused sessions.\n",

Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right!\n\n\u200B\n\nMost people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022 Truth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted.

(To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long.

It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster.

We\u2019ve taken the first-person camera footage and power data from a pro cyclist and analyzed it to determine which part of their 4DP\u00AE profile each of their efforts corresponds to. But since few of us can put down pro-level watts, we made it so all of the efforts are scaled to your own personal 4DP\u00AE profile. That means you get to experience exactly what the pros experience relative to your own abilities. When they sprint, you sprint. When they attack, you attack. When they sit up, you get to take it (relatively) easy. It\u0027s the most immersive, realistic race simulation out there.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s some more information on how to create the most immersive ProRides experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterProRides)\n",

This session provides a full range of Micro Intervals, from 50 seconds down to 10 seconds, covering the full spectrum of 4DP targets from FTP up to NM. With long recoveries in between sets, you shouldn\u0027t have a problem hitting your targets, but it is still quite a challenging session. While you don\u0027t need to be fully rested and tapered as you would for a test session, you\u0027ll still want to come into this session feeling fairly fresh. \nAlso, just a friendly reminder that this workout is best done in level mode. You could certainly get away with starting in ERG mode and changing to Level mode when you get to the 30-second set (3rd set), however, riding the whole thing in level mode can be a good challenge, especially if you tend to use ERG mode most of the time. \n\nAre you up for a \u0022little\u0022 challenge?\n",

You\u0027ve been chosen to help get your team\u0027s star sprinter, Alexander Kristoff, in position to take the win. You need to be ready to bury yourself in service of your team. It might not be the most glamorous, but it will earn you the respect and admiration of your teammates. There are stars and there are water carriers: today you\u0027re loading up with bottles.\n\n\u200B\n\n**About ProRides**\n\nHere\u2019s your chance to experience what it\u2019s like to ride in the biggest races in the world, thanks to SYSTM\u2019s 4DP platform. We\u2019ve taken the first-person camera footage and power data from a pro cyclist and analyzed it to determine which part of their 4DP\u00AE profile each of their efforts corresponds to. But since few of us can put down pro-level watts, we made it so all of the efforts are scaled to your own personal 4DP\u00AE profile. That means you get to experience exactly what the pros experience relative to your own abilities. When they sprint, you sprint. When they attack, you attack. When they sit up, you get to take it (relatively) easy. It\u0027s the most immersive, realistic race simulation out there.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s some more information on how to create the most immersive ProRides experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterProRides)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Featured Footage: **Velon\n",

While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are just times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right!\n\n\u200B\n\nMost people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022 Truth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted. So what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like?\n\nFor 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70% is ok, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm and your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster.

This one may be short but it\u2019ll have you hanging onto the edge of your saddle as we explore the Pilancones Natural Park, high up on a mountain ridge overlooking the Soria valley as we head towards Chira Lake. The goal of this ride will be to work on your good form with a slightly higher cadence than normal, keeping the legs supple and spinning. We\u2019ll gently build the effort up a 3km climb to get the heart, legs and lungs working a little harder before descending to our final destination at Chira Lake. This workout is perfect for those days when you need an easier session or want to activate the body before going deeper.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis workout focusses on a progressive build through the duration of the climb helping with your pacing skills and sustained efforts.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/8773915186)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.
