As a National Champion on the track himself, and having coached countless track athletes, Neal\u0027s happy to introduce you to the boards with a series of challenges. You\u0027ll start with a little paceline work to ease into things (yes, you\u0027ll have to take your pulls). It gets more difficult from there, as you\u0027ll need to try to lap the group before hitching a ride with a multiple National and World Champion. You\u0027ll finish it off, of course, with a massive Kilometer effort.\n\n\u200B\n\nIn between, you\u0027ll learn a bit more about how Neal spends his recovery time, from gardening to family walks to time spent in his very own chill-out room.\n\n\u200B\n\n**When to ride: Do this on day 5 of the 7-day plan.**\n\n\u200B\n\n_About: Neal Henderson is one of the most accomplished coaches in cycling and multi-sport. His athletes have won more than 50 World Championships, set numerous world and national records, captured Olympic medals, worn leaders jerseys, and won stages in races like the Tour de France.

          "description": "While the single tempo effort you complete in this session is steady in terms of power, it\u0027s the specific cadence targets that set this session apart from other tempo workouts.\n\n\u200B\n\nEven though an effort at 80% of FTP might seem \u0022easy\u0022, the truth is your body is working at processing oxygen and metabolites at nearly the same rate as when you are right at FTP. The difference is that the overall stress on your system when riding tempo is considerably less than while riding at FTP. That means you can either have harder days before or after a tempo session (compared to a threshold session) or you can increase the duration of those tempo efforts to make the overall training stimulus equal (or greater) than completing several repeats right at your FTP.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis tempo effort is divided into 3 segments of equal duration. While the power is the same across all segments, your target cadence starts off low and increases with each new segment from 60rpm, 75rpm and finally 95rpm. Starting with a long block of low cadence should fatigue your muscles from the start of your effort. As the effort builds and you create more fatigue, the increased cadence targets will place a greater demand on your cardiovascular system. That will feel like a nice break given the load you have been putting on your muscular system. The cadence targets in the final segment will force your fatigued muscles to maintain good coordination as the faster cadence requires your muscles to switch \u0022on\u0022 and \u0022off\u0022 at a faster rate. Between the low-RPM sections and the high-RPM work under fatigue, this tempo session not only helps train your FTP, but also benefits your neuromuscular system.\n\n\u200B\n\nYou can expect your heart rate to remain low for the power targets during the low cadence segment at the start. As the effort progresses and you reach the final 10 minutes of the high rpm segment, your heart rate might go over Z3, which is not something to worry about. While this session appears \u0022easy\u0022 at first glance, don\u0027t be surprised if your legs are feeling it the next day.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n30 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 8 -- 105% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of sets: 3\n\nRest between sets: NA\n\nInterval repeats per: NA\n\n**Interval**\n\nBuild 1: 20 minutes @ RPE 5 -- 80% of FTP -- HR \u003C80% at 60rpm\n\nBuild 2: 20 minutes @ RPE 5 -- 80% of FTP -- HR \u003C80% at 75rpm\n\nBuild 3: 20 minutes @ RPE 5 -- 80% of FTP -- HR \u003C80% at 95rpm\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n1 hour 15 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right!\n\n\u200B\n\nMost people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022 Truth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted.

Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm and your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster. You will have to trust us on that one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions! Or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 11\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 1\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

This one may be short but it\u2019ll have you hanging onto the edge of your saddle as we explore the Pilancones Natural Park, high up on a mountain ridge overlooking the Soria valley as we head towards Chira Lake. The goal of this ride will be to work on your good form with a slightly higher cadence than normal, keeping the legs supple and spinning. We\u2019ll gently build the effort up a 3km climb to get the heart, legs and lungs working a little harder before descending to our final destination at Chira Lake. This workout is perfect for those days when you need an easier session or want to activate the body before going deeper.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis workout focusses on a progressive build through the duration of the climb helping with your pacing skills and sustained efforts.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/8773915186)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

          "description": "The goal of this workout is to help develop your baseline aerobic fitness. While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high and your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week. Shorter Endurance rides (like this one) can fit in both a hard week of training and a recovery week. That is, only if you do it right! Most people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022\n\n\u200B\n\nTruth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride, especially one under 90 minutes should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted.\n\nSo what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like? For 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70%, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in low to mid Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can; for most this is 80-90rpm. Also, your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right?
