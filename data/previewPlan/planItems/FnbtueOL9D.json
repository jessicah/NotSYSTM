The project was designed to explore and scout a bikepacking route that would connect the bustling metropolis of Bogota, Colombia with rural communities and the Chingaza National Park. The resulting route \u2014 Ruta Chingaza \u2014 will help cyclists connect to nature and better understand the ecosystems upon which life and livelihoods in this area depend.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: The workout accompanying this film is a recovery session. Intensity is low, with power remaining at or below 50% of FTP (2.5 on a scale from 1 to 10) with heart rate targets entirely in Zone 1. The intensity and cadence targets will vary throughout this session to keep it interesting, but not so much that it distracts you from the story.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s how to turn off on-screen graphics for the best viewing experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterInspiration)\n",

After sampling Tejeda\u2019s famous almond and dark chocolate cookies it\u2019s time to hit the road for a block of 4 x 4 min low cadence with 1 min high cadence drills. Taking a moment to let that cookie settle and get back in the green we\u2019ll follow this up with a short 3 min 30 second low cadence effort before our next block of low cadence / high cadence repeats, this time for 2 minute / 1 minute intervals. With the summit tantalisingly close and as the effort starts to take its toll we\u2019re going to have to really focus on the road ahead as we build our effort towards Pico de las Nieves where by the summit we can well and truly say that we\u2019ve conquered Gran Canaria!\n\n\u200B\n\nThis workout focusses on cadence work which helps with muscular endurance making it an efficient threshold session working at a variety of cadence targets.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/8764050850)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

For the past three weeks, you\u0027ve battled your way across Italy. What better way to finish than leaving it all on the road in a final, short time trial. It\u0027s you against the clock in the race of truth.\n\n\u200B\n\n**About ProRides**\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever dreamed of being a professional cyclist, now\u2019s your chance. The SYSTM ProRide series allows you to experience what it\u2019s like to be in the biggest bike races in the world, thanks to the SYSTM 4DP\u00AE platform. We\u2019ve taken the first-person camera footage and power data from a pro cyclist and analyzed it to determine which part of their 4DP\u00AE profile each of their efforts corresponds to. But since few of us can put down pro-level watts, we made it so all of the efforts are scaled to your own personal 4DP\u00AE profile. That means you get to experience exactly what the pros experience relative to your own abilities. When they sprint, you sprint. When they attack, you attack. When they sit up, you get to take it (relatively) easy. It\u0027s the most immersive, realistic race simulation out there.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s some more information on how to create the most immersive ProRides experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterProRides)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Featured Footage: **Velon\n",
