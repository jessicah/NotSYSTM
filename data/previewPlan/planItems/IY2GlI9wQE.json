          "description": "One of the best sessions for neuromuscular training, this drill asks you to progressively build from a cadence of 90 RPM to your MAX over 30 seconds, recover, and repeat several times. Cadence builds improve how you recruit your leg, gluteal, and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke by progressing to your maximal cadence. By reaching your highest cadence possible, you are training the \u0027on/off\u0027 switch in each muscle group to not only work faster but to have less overlap with your other muscle groups. This session trains your hamstring muscles to \u0027turn off\u0027 when your quads \u0027turn on\u0027 and vice-versa, resulting in a more efficient pedal stroke at both high and low cadences.\n\n\u200B\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to The Knowledge podcast, by Wahoo Sports Science - The Benefits of High Cadence Training: [https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence](https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence)\n",

          "description": "Do you have Couchlandrian Tendencies? This short but powerful workout will cure you of that affliction and reassert your inner Sufferlandrian. The session is based on a combination of specific micro-intervals (made famous by Japanese coach and physiologist Izumi Tabata) that we combined with classic tempo efforts. This gives you a superb mix of Anaerobic Capacity (AC), Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP), and FTP training stresses in one short workout to help you go faster and stay stronger for longer.\n\n\u200B\n\nNow, for the sports science purists among you, the \u0027Tabata\u0027 intervals should actually be named \u0027Koichi\u0027 intervals, since it was Japanese speedskating coach Irisawa Koichi who first employed the use of the 20-seconds on / 10-seconds off intervals that Dr. Izumi then confirmed via physiology lab studies to yield the best mix of maximal aerobic and anaerobic stress among the different on/off protocols that he tested.\n\n\u200B\n\nFor this workout, we have toned down the original intensity of the Tabata intervals to target MAP rather than Anaerobic Capacity in order to be able to complete the 20/10 micro-intervals and then follow the short efforts immediately with sustained 80-100% of FTP intervals to replicate the kind of attack and then settle efforts that are common in cycling races.\n\n\u200B\n\nFrom a physiological perspective, you\u2019ll produce lots of lactate during the micro-intervals. Then the goal of the tempo and FTP efforts is to stress your body\u2019s capacity to clear that lactate as quickly as possible. Effectively, we\u2019re trying to maximize lactate \u0027flux.\u0027 For each successive round of the efforts, you\u2019ll do one less micro-interval, and the tempo efforts will get shorter. But because you\u2019re a Sufferlandrian, they won\u2019t get easier, and the rest between sets will get shorter. The intensity for the tempo efforts will ramp up with each repetition. Fortunately for you, there are only 3 sets of efforts and you\u2019ll be done in just 30 minutes. If you\u2019ve set aside an hour for this workout, you\u2019ll be happy to have those additional 30 minutes for recovery after this session.\n",

          "description": "Meandering along the scenic River Iller, it\u2019s time to break out your gravel bike for a classic cadence build and hold session. We\u2019ll kick off with 5 x 30-second cadence builds, allowing for 2 minutes of recovery between each, before moving on to 5 x 60-second cadence holds, again with 2 minutes recovery.\n\nWhile this session may be short, it\u2019s a key part of your weekly plan, designed to keep you efficient and in top form, even when the cadence ramps up. Stay smooth and steady\u2014and remember, \u201Cno bobbing!\u201D\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Builds:** The name of the game here is absolute peak cadence, not peak power. To achieve this, you need to be in a small gear and have very light resistance. Starting at 90-RPM, steadily increase your cadence until you reach your absolute max with about 5-seconds left, and hold that to the end. Your limiting factor on these efforts needs to be leg speed. If resistance/power output is your limiting factor, try starting in an easier gear, or shift into an easier gear 15-seconds in. Bouncing in the saddle is okay for this drill.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Holds**: These efforts require you to maintain the highest cadence you can without starting to bounce in the saddle. For some of you that will be 100-RPM, for others, it will be 150-RPM. The key is to settle into YOUR peak sustainable cadence. Like the Builds, the goal here is not high power, so these efforts are limited to 90% of FTP. Do not be surprised if your heart rate is well into Zone 4 by the time you hit the last few holds.\n\n\nTo properly execute this session, your effort between drills needs to be low. With limited recovery time between these maximal Neuromuscular Efforts, riding above Zone 1 between efforts will only reduce your ability to max out your cadence. While the power targets between are Zone 1, do not be surprised if your heart rate does not drop below Zone 2 after the first couple builds.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/9885886076)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

The shorter duration, sub-threshold efforts are fantastic for getting some extra FTP building while you are in a fatigued state. Extra emphasis on cadence stresses your nervous system, making your body more efficient at higher and lower RPMs while improving your form. The Neuromuscular training you get from this session is fantastic, so while your power never exceeds threshold, your body will learn to bring more energy to the pedals at all intensities.\n",

          "description": "Starting at the islands iconic rainbow rocks at Los Azulejos de Veneguera in this session we tackle one of the most stunning climbs on the whole island, known locally as \u201CSerenity\u201D. We\u2019ll be breaking this 10km climb down into three distinct sections, kicking off with a block of 6 x 50 second high tempo efforts with a 10 second burst out of the saddle before taking a swift breather before getting back on it. As we climb through the pine forest we\u2019ll switch things up a touch, alternating between low and high cadence for 30 seconds at a time for around 7 minutes. We\u2019ll then revert back to our 50 second high tempo with 10 second burst out of the saddle efforts before we build up our effort to the summit. This is going to be a challenging workout so make sure you\u2019re ready and whatever you do don\u2019t forget to take a moment to look at the views!!\n\n\u200B\n\nThis workout combines multiple different interval types that focus on improving threshold power via over-under style efforts along with low cadence work for your muscular endurance. The first and last climbs also fire up your whole energy systems with some sprints to the summit.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/8735613403)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

The goal on this first stage from Tanunda to Williamstown is to make a mark on the race and, ideally, get on the podium. You\u2019ll join the race with 58 kilometers to go and experience all the thrilling action exactly as Nicole did \u2013 but relative to your own fitness level.\n\n\u200B\n\n**About ProRides**\n\nHere\u2019s your chance to experience what it\u2019s like to ride in the biggest races in the world, thanks to SYSTM\u2019s 4DP platform. We\u2019ve taken the first-person camera footage and power data from a pro cyclist and analyzed it to determine which part of their 4DP\u00AE profile each of their efforts corresponds to. But since few of us can put down pro-level watts, we made it so all of the efforts are scaled to your own personal 4DP\u00AE profile. That means you get to experience exactly what the pros experience relative to your own abilities. When they sprint, you sprint. When they attack, you attack. When they sit up, you get to take it (relatively) easy. It\u0027s the most immersive, realistic race simulation out there.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s some more information on how to create the most immersive ProRides experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterProRides)\n",

Made This presented by Wahoo \u002B MAAP is a series of behind-the-scenes, unfiltered front-row access with women\u0027s pro cycling team Lifeplus - Wahoo:\n\n1. **Sisterhood: **Dedication, challenges, commitment, belief, family and sisterhood are all components of what it takes to be a professional racing team. In the first of a series of behind-the-scenes, unfiltered front-row access with team Lifeplus-Wahoo, MADE THIS is a collection of short films from MAAP Pro Team Racing that reveals what it takes to make a champion a champion.\n2. **Prepared for anything: **The excitement of Holy Week at the Tour de Flanders is upon us, and Team Lifeplus-Wahoo is gearing up for a challenging ride. With 163km to conquer, featuring 12 climbs and seven cobbled stretches, not to mention seven slippery flat stone sections\u2014all under a deluge of rain\u2014anything could happen.\n3. **Passion on the cobbles: **Join us as we dive deep into the chaotic and exhilarating world of the Paris-Roubaix, one of cycling\u0027s most grueling races. Amidst the cobblestones and mud, Team Lifeplus-Wahoo faces the ultimate test of endurance and skill. With a new lineup and high stakes, the team navigates the unpredictable nature of this legendary race, where luck can play a huge role and every second counts.\n4. **Home sweet home: **After a fallow year for the tour, the team are eager to push for results in front of an expectant crowd. But instead of the warm welcome on familiar roads, disaster strikes the first morning of the race. As national news of the unfortunate event breaks, the team are left wondering if they\u0027ll be able to compete or if this becomes a home visit to forget. What follows is a true act of human kindness and a gesture that symbolises the unifying bond of the women\u0027s pro peloton.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: The workout accompanying this film is a recovery session. It\u0027s a very low-intensity ride, with your power remaining at or below 50% of FTP (an RPE less than 2.5 on a scale from 1 to 10) and your heart rate in Zone 1. The intensity and cadence targets will vary throughout this session to keep it interesting, but not so much that it distracts you from the story.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s how to turn off on-screen graphics for the best viewing experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterInspiration)\n",

          "description": "This workout combines several technique driven intervals. These will improve your overall form and efficiency on the bike. The first two drills, Cadence Holds and Builds, are designed to improve the way you recruit your leg, glute and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke. They do this by forcing you to sustain a cadence just above \u0027comfortable\u0027 and by pushing you to your maximal cadence.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe last drill, Single Leg Efforts, ask you to unclip one leg and ride at a steady, single-legged effort. This forces you to pull up on the pedal instead of just pushing down and ensures maximal muscle awareness and engagement. This workout is best done while riding indoors on a trainer because even small variations in terrain can affect your ability to properly execute this workout. The majority of this workout is done in heart rate Z1/2 /// 50-75% of threshold /// RPE 2-5. You should keep the effort level below threshold (heart rate Z4, 100% of threshold, RPE 7-8) during the max cadence efforts.\n\n\u200B\n\nWORKOUT GOALS:\n\n- To improve stillness and stability at high cadences.\n- To improve muscle fiber engagement for improved efficiency at all cadences.\n- To increase maximum cadence.\n- To make that pedal stroke as smooth as butter.\n\nCADENCE TARGETS:\n\n- Warm-up 80-90rpm\n- Build: 90-150rpm\n- Hold: 115rpm\n- Single Leg: 85rpm\n\nListen to The Knowledge podcast, by Wahoo Sports Science - The Benefits of High Cadence Training: [https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence](https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n3 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 3\n\nRest Between Sets: 8 minutes @ RPE 23 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: N/A\n\n**Interval**\n\nCadence Build: 30 seconds @ RPE 8 -- Starting at 90RPM Build to Max RPM -- Max Power is NOT Goal\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nCadence Hold: 45 seconds @ RPE 7.5 -- \u003C100% FTP -- Highest RPM you can hold without Bouncing\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nSingle Leg: 1 minute @ RPE 6 -- Single Leg Only -- \u003C50% of FTP\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nSingle Leg: 1 minute @ RPE 6 -- Single Leg Only, Opposite Leg -- \u003C50% of FTP (100% of FTP with both legs = 50% of FTP\n\nwith one leg)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n8 minutes 15 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

          "description": "This session is all about high-torque efforts, very similar to the efforts you would experience riding up the steep slopes of Mt Sufferlandria. While these efforts are short and the intensity isn\u2019t too high, the low cadence targets combined with minimal recovery will leave some begging for the high-cadence sprints of _The Omnium_. High-torque efforts like these have two primary benefits: improved neuromuscular coordination and increased muscular endurance.\n\n\u200B\n\nDuring each pedal revolution, your legs have to \u201Cswitch on\u201D and \u201Cswitch off\u201D almost all of the muscles in your legs. High-cadence efforts in something like _Cadence Builds_ are great for teaching these groups to make that switch quickly. These low-cadence efforts are better for teaching ALL of the muscles in your legs to \u201Cswitch on.\u201D Done properly, you should be pulling with your hamstrings with one leg while the other leg is pushing down with all the force your glutes and quads can muster. If you feel like you are pushing yourself up out of the saddle during harder efforts (like seated sprints), your hamstrings are not being utilized since they should pull you back down into your saddle.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe second main benefit is improved muscular endurance. Even though the session is under 45 minutes, **you\u0027ll put a similar amount of muscular fatigue into your legs as a steady, multi-hour base ride.** You can almost view this session as hitting the leg press for 8 sets of 100 reps. And just like the weight room, proper form is absolutely key. That means:\n\n- You should focus on pushing down AND pulling back up. You want your glutes and quads activated on the way down and your hamstring and hip flexors activated on the way up.\n- To properly engage your hamstrings think about trying to pulling your heel up to your butt when your crank arm is going from 6 o\u2019clock to 10 o\u2019clock.\n- Your knees should be tracking straight up and down, no collapsing in or out.\n- Your core should be fully engaged to keep your hips steady in the saddle. This will be easier if you are both pushing and pulling during each pedal revolution.\n\nThis session is very similar to _Power Station_. Both help improve your muscular endurance and coordination; the biggest difference is the work to rest ratio between the two. While the intervals here are shorter than those in _Power Station_, the decreased recovery duration means fatigue will build faster, especially for those with a weakness in repeated efforts.\n\nModifying interval length and recovery duration can also be seen between sessions like _Revolver_ and _A Very Dark Place_. Both serve up a healthy dose of MAP/VO2 work, but the overall feeling of those two sessions is different.\n\nIf you find that your lower back starts to ache during this session or that you have to start rocking in the saddle to keep the power up, then it\u2019s time for you to get started on the SYSTM Yoga program. Kick it off with \u201CCore Strengtheners \u201D to make sure your core is just as strong as those legs.\n\n\u200B\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to \u0027[When to Train with Low Cadence](https://the-knowledge-by-wahoo-sports-science.simplecast.com/episodes/when-to-train-with-low-cadence)\u0027 on The Knowledge Podcast by Wahoo Sports Science.\n",

          "description": "One of the few Sufferfest sessions that can be viewed as a sweet-spot session since the intervals aren\u2019t above threshold (except for the very end) but are harder than a tempo effort.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session pushes your body close to the limit of what it can comfortably handle without going any further. Why? Going above threshold causes a considerable amount of hormonal stress that takes a lot of time to recover from. But you don\u2019t actually have to ride above threshold to improve your FTP. The difference in fitness gains between 30 minutes at 90% of threshold and at 102% of threshold is minimal. Still, the stress on your body from the latter is much greater, and the recovery much longer.\n\n\u200B\n\nThat\u0027s why this session is a key component to any training plan: It gives you enough training stress to help improve your FTP but remains \u0027easy\u0027 enough that you can do it when you\u0027re tired or before a big block of harder efforts.\n",

We\u2019ve taken the first-person camera footage and power data from a pro cyclist and analyzed it to determine which part of their 4DP\u00AE profile each of their efforts corresponds to. But since few of us can put down pro-level watts, we made it so all of the efforts are scaled to your own personal 4DP\u00AE profile. That means you get to experience exactly what the pros experience relative to your own abilities. When they sprint, you sprint. When they attack, you attack. When they sit up, you get to take it (relatively) easy. It\u0027s the most immersive, realistic race simulation out there.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s some more information on how to create the most immersive ProRides experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterProRides)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Featured Footage: **Velon\n",

          "description": "Meandering along the scenic River Iller, it\u2019s time to break out your gravel bike for a classic cadence build and hold session. We\u2019ll kick off with 5 x 30-second cadence builds, allowing for 2 minutes of recovery between each, before moving on to 5 x 60-second cadence holds, again with 2 minutes recovery.\n\nWhile this session may be short, it\u2019s a key part of your weekly plan, designed to keep you efficient and in top form, even when the cadence ramps up. Stay smooth and steady\u2014and remember, \u201Cno bobbing!\u201D\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Builds:** The name of the game here is absolute peak cadence, not peak power. To achieve this, you need to be in a small gear and have very light resistance. Starting at 90-RPM, steadily increase your cadence until you reach your absolute max with about 5-seconds left, and hold that to the end. Your limiting factor on these efforts needs to be leg speed. If resistance/power output is your limiting factor, try starting in an easier gear, or shift into an easier gear 15-seconds in. Bouncing in the saddle is okay for this drill.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Holds**: These efforts require you to maintain the highest cadence you can without starting to bounce in the saddle. For some of you that will be 100-RPM, for others, it will be 150-RPM. The key is to settle into YOUR peak sustainable cadence. Like the Builds, the goal here is not high power, so these efforts are limited to 90% of FTP. Do not be surprised if your heart rate is well into Zone 4 by the time you hit the last few holds.\n\n\nTo properly execute this session, your effort between drills needs to be low. With limited recovery time between these maximal Neuromuscular Efforts, riding above Zone 1 between efforts will only reduce your ability to max out your cadence. While the power targets between are Zone 1, do not be surprised if your heart rate does not drop below Zone 2 after the first couple builds.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/9885886076)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

As your On Location co-creator and host, Mike\u0027s engaging character, curious mind, and friendly nature will have you cueing up your next ride with him before you\u0027ve even finished the cool-down._\n",

This session is similar to The Trick, with a few differences. On the plus side, all of the efforts are 15-seconds shorter than those in The Trick. To make up for this, we added two more intervals to this session, bringing the total to 6. That means by the end of this session you will have plowed through 4.5-minutes of AC work.\n\nThis workout is one of the few sessions that we do NOT recommend you complete in ERG mode if you are on a smart trainer. The goal is to hold onto the highest power you can for the full 45-seconds. Inevitably in the later sets, your power will dip before you reach the end of the interval. What we want is for you to complete every effort having given everything for 45-seconds. We don\u0027t want ERG mode grinding you to a halt because you cannot maintain the (ridiculously) high power targets. Even if you drop down below FTP in the final 10-seconds of these efforts, as long as you are going flat out, you are doing it correctly.\n\nJust take this session one interval at a time, and focus on giving your all for this one effort. You can worry about the others when you get to them.

You\u2019ll want to savor every second of those short recoveries. This workout will help improve your FTP and improve your ability to recover while pushing just under your threshold for the first half of each effort. You\u2019ll also learn to manage your pacing and put out power above your threshold after holding steady just below that breakpoint.\n\n\u200B\n\nRiders with sustained weakness will benefit greatly from this workout, as will anyone looking to push up their FTP.\n\n_Attacker_ is quite similar to the SUF workout, _Defender._ However, the efforts within each interval are 2-minutes shorter, and instead of starting harder and backing off like in _Defender,_ the efforts in this session start controlled and keep squeezing harder and harder until the end.\n",

The first two drills, Cadence Holds and Builds, are designed to improve the way you recruit your leg, glute and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke. They do this by forcing you to sustain a cadence just above \u0027comfortable\u0027 and by pushing you to your maximal cadence.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe last drill, Single Leg Efforts, ask you to unclip one leg and ride at a steady, single-legged effort. This forces you to pull up on the pedal instead of just pushing down and ensures maximal muscle awareness and engagement. This workout is best done while riding indoors on a trainer because even small variations in terrain can affect your ability to properly execute this workout. The majority of this workout is done in heart rate Z1/2 /// 50-75% of threshold /// RPE 2-5. You should keep the effort level below threshold (heart rate Z4, 100% of threshold, RPE 7-8) during the max cadence efforts.\n\n\u200B\n\nWORKOUT GOALS:\n\n- To improve stillness and stability at high cadences.\n- To improve muscle fiber engagement for improved efficiency at all cadences.\n- To increase maximum cadence.\n- To make that pedal stroke as smooth as butter.\n\nCADENCE TARGETS:\n\n- Warm-up 80-90rpm\n- Build: 90-150rpm\n- Hold: 115rpm\n- Single Leg: 85rpm\n\nListen to The Knowledge podcast, by Wahoo Sports Science - The Benefits of High Cadence Training: [https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence](https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n3 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 3\n\nRest Between Sets: 8 minutes @ RPE 23 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: N/A\n\n**Interval**\n\nCadence Build: 30 seconds @ RPE 8 -- Starting at 90RPM Build to Max RPM -- Max Power is NOT Goal\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nCadence Hold: 45 seconds @ RPE 7.5 -- \u003C100% FTP -- Highest RPM you can hold without Bouncing\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nSingle Leg: 1 minute @ RPE 6 -- Single Leg Only -- \u003C50% of FTP\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nSingle Leg: 1 minute @ RPE 6 -- Single Leg Only, Opposite Leg -- \u003C50% of FTP (100% of FTP with both legs = 50% of FTP\n\nwith one leg)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n8 minutes 15 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

This session is designed to sharpen muscle activation and improve recovery after intense efforts.\n\nFinish strong, and I\u2019ll see you in Burgberg!\n\n\u200B\n\nWith short near-maximal sprint efforts like these, you\u2019ll recruit all of the muscle fibers in your legs. While cadence builds force your muscles to contract and relax as quickly as possible, this session forces your muscles to contract with maximal power. Just like cadence builds, this session becomes one of the best ways to train your neuromuscular system.\n\nEven if your target event does not require you to complete maximal sprints, there is a substantial trickle-down efficiency effect to the longer-duration power efforts when you train your neuromuscular system.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/9866624296)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

But it\u0027s gone on too long and we had to respond. So, over a bottle of Real Pagne, legendary Directeur Sportif Grunter von Agony had a quiet word with a man named Ian Field. You may know that Ian is an elite coach with Dig Deep Coaching and a four-time British National Cyclocross National Champion. After an evil laugh that lingered, he provided us with a workout he uses to perform at the highest levels of the Cyclocross World Cup. \u0027Don\u0027t worry,\u0027 said Ian. \u0027The Couchlandrians will enjoy half of it.\u0027\n\n\u200B\n\nThis is a fantastic session for improving Anaerobic Capacity (AC). The short, high-intensity efforts with equally short recoveries stress your body\u0027s ability to recover quickly. In fact, the recoveries are short enough that you never really get a \u201Cfull recovery\u201D during a set. This means your Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) is developed in the latter half of both sets as fatigue sets in. It\u0027s also worth mentioning that because of the short durations, you do tap into your Neuromuscular Power (NM) at the start of each effort.\n",

Then you settle into a controlled, below-FTP effort that will accelerate the rate at which you can clear lactate from your muscles. You\u0027ll finish each effort off with a big surge based on your Anaerobic Capacity (AC). In just 30 minutes, you\u0027ll be doing efforts targeting your sprint power, FTP, and AC for an exceptionally well-rounded workout.\n\n\u200B\n\nSupport the Wahooligan Tour by [donating to the Davis Phinney Foundation](https://secure2.convio.net/dpf/site/TR?pg=pfind\u0026fr_id=1391) and their programs to help people living with Parkinsons.\n",

To win requires riding almost non-stop, night and day, for days on end. It\u0027s a combination of strength and sleep deprivation that only a few riders in the world can manage. Alone, unsupported and loaded down with supplies, each competitor must constantly battle mechanicals, heat exhaustion and saddle sores to get to the finish. There is no prize, no money, simply the satisfaction that comes from pushing oneself to the limit while exploring the forgotten corners of a beautiful country. With support from PEdALED, Canyon, Fizik and the race crew led by organiser and route creator Nelson Trees, filmmaker Brady Lawrence followed the race documenting everything from a brutal 80 kilometre walk through the high desert with a broken bike, to one racer\u2019s simple joy at realising they\u2019ll soon eat their first warm meal in days. Featuring the sport\u2019s biggest names and first-time, ultra- distance racers alike, the film gets up close to the kind of people crazy enough to take on this epic challenge.

          "description": "Meandering along the scenic River Iller, it\u2019s time to break out your gravel bike for a classic cadence build and hold session. We\u2019ll kick off with 5 x 30-second cadence builds, allowing for 2 minutes of recovery between each, before moving on to 5 x 60-second cadence holds, again with 2 minutes recovery.\n\nWhile this session may be short, it\u2019s a key part of your weekly plan, designed to keep you efficient and in top form, even when the cadence ramps up. Stay smooth and steady\u2014and remember, \u201Cno bobbing!\u201D\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Builds:** The name of the game here is absolute peak cadence, not peak power. To achieve this, you need to be in a small gear and have very light resistance. Starting at 90-RPM, steadily increase your cadence until you reach your absolute max with about 5-seconds left, and hold that to the end. Your limiting factor on these efforts needs to be leg speed. If resistance/power output is your limiting factor, try starting in an easier gear, or shift into an easier gear 15-seconds in. Bouncing in the saddle is okay for this drill.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Holds**: These efforts require you to maintain the highest cadence you can without starting to bounce in the saddle. For some of you that will be 100-RPM, for others, it will be 150-RPM. The key is to settle into YOUR peak sustainable cadence. Like the Builds, the goal here is not high power, so these efforts are limited to 90% of FTP. Do not be surprised if your heart rate is well into Zone 4 by the time you hit the last few holds.\n\n\nTo properly execute this session, your effort between drills needs to be low. With limited recovery time between these maximal Neuromuscular Efforts, riding above Zone 1 between efforts will only reduce your ability to max out your cadence. While the power targets between are Zone 1, do not be surprised if your heart rate does not drop below Zone 2 after the first couple builds.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/9885886076)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

The term \u0022Taper\u0022 refers to how you train in the week or so before your target event to ensure you deliver your best performance. Generally, tapering means reducing your total training volume but continuing to hit some high-intensity efforts. While there are individual variations in the best way to taper, this session has been used by countless professionals leading into the biggest races of their lives -- athletes like World Champions Rohan Dennis and Flora Duffy.\n\n\u200B\n\nWith 3 sets of micro-intervals (40/20s, 30/30s, and 20/40s) you will hit your system with just enough intensity to keep your legs sharp and responsive, without adding any real fatigue. Outside of those 3 sets of micro-intervals, this session is purposefully short and easy. This is a preparation session, not a training session! After all, your event is just around the corner and all of the important training is behind you. Riding harder or longer today will do absolutely nothing to increase your fitness by event day; in fact, all that would do is increase your fatigue, which will only hurt your performance. Rather, this session makes sure your body is humming along and ready to perform on the big day.\n",

It introduces the most basic versions of moves that make up the majority of this program. Some of these moves may seem very basic but we encourage you to focus on perfect form and execution during these early levels so that when we turn up the heat you have things nailed. As you\u0027ll see, all the exercises at the lower levels will progress in a similar fashion going forward. We\u0027re building strength, but also fine-tuning your nervous system. As the program progresses you\u0027ll be asked to complete more difficult variations on each foundational move.\n\n\u200B\n\nAs with all the strength training routines, it helps if you\u2019ve done a warm-up before getting started. That can be one of your favorite yoga routines, riding your bike on the trainer for 5-10 minutes, or doing a personal stretching routine.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?

With a substantial progression, there\u2019s enough here to keep you busy -- and improving -- for a very long time._\n\n\u200B\n\nThis is the first routine in the Full Body series. It introduces the most basic versions of moves that make up the majority of this program. Some of these moves may seem very basic but we encourage you to focus on perfect form and execution during these early levels so that when we turn up the heat you have things nailed. As you\u0027ll see, all the exercises at the lower levels will progress in a similar fashion going forward. We\u0027re building strength, but also fine-tuning your nervous system. As the program progresses you\u0027ll be asked to complete more difficult variations on each foundational move.\n\n\u200B\n\nAs with all the strength training routines, it helps if you\u2019ve done a warm-up before getting started. That can be one of your favorite yoga routines, riding your bike on the trainer for 5-10 minutes, or doing a personal stretching routine.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?

This includes everything from your powerful glutes, hamstrings, and calves to the postural muscles of your upper back and neck._\n\n\u200B\n\nYour posterior chain is responsible for back and hip extension as well as knee flexion. It is vital in maintaining optimal posture during cycling and running in addition to water position in swimming. In this first session, we introduce some basic movements that focus on the activation and stabilization of posterior chain muscles. These moves include a combination of eccentric (lengthening), concentric (shortening), and isometric (holding) contractions. They provide your body with the foundation for more demanding moves to come. This is also a good session to come back to if you feel like you could use a quick posterior chain activation or tune-up.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?

This includes everything from your powerful glutes, hamstrings, and calves to the postural muscles of your upper back and neck._\n\n\u200B\n\nYour posterior chain is responsible for back and hip extension as well as knee flexion. It is vital in maintaining optimal posture during cycling and running in addition to water position in swimming. In this first session, we introduce some basic movements that focus on the activation and stabilization of posterior chain muscles. These moves include a combination of eccentric (lengthening), concentric (shortening), and isometric (holding) contractions. They provide your body with the foundation for more demanding moves to come. This is also a good session to come back to if you feel like you could use a quick posterior chain activation or tune-up.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?

It is vital in maintaining optimal posture during cycling and running in addition to water position in swimming. In this first session, we introduce some basic movements that focus on the activation and stabilization of posterior chain muscles. These moves include a combination of eccentric (lengthening), concentric (shortening), and isometric (holding) contractions.

Some of these moves may seem very basic but we encourage you to focus on perfect form and execution during these early levels so that when we turn up the heat you have things nailed. As you\u0027ll see, all the exercises at the lower levels will progress in a similar fashion going forward. We\u0027re building strength, but also fine-tuning your nervous system.

Something like Improving Posture, Shake Off the Day or Recovery Booster would be perfect.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Exercises Included**\n\n- Kneeling Hip Drive with Hands Over Head\n- Kneeling Hip Drive with Hips Side to Side\n- High Plank to Pigeon Pose\n- Plank with Leg Lifts\n- Hip Bridge with Reps\n- Fast Lateral Lunges with Knees Up\n- Standing Hip Drive with Hands Up\n- Standing Hip Drive with Hands Side to Side\n",

This includes everything from your powerful glutes, hamstrings, and calves to the postural muscles of your upper back and neck._\n\n\u200B\n\nYour posterior chain is responsible for back and hip extension as well as knee flexion. It is vital in maintaining optimal posture during cycling and running in addition to water position in swimming. In this first session, we introduce some basic movements that focus on the activation and stabilization of posterior chain muscles. These moves include a combination of eccentric (lengthening), concentric (shortening), and isometric (holding) contractions. They provide your body with the foundation for more demanding moves to come. This is also a good session to come back to if you feel like you could use a quick posterior chain activation or tune-up.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?

To do this, we use a combination of isolated and integrated movements in a variety of body positions and build on the movements from Posterior Chain 1. We also introduce tempo movements that require extra focus on timing and eccentric loading. Even though this is only Level 2, you may find some of these moves difficult to perform.

The result? Improved core strength, stability, and endurance. You\u0027ll find exercises that carry over into other areas of your body, but all of the moves have a significant impact on your core. Level 1 is ideal for very beginners. Even then, you may find some of these moves challenging if you have never attempted them. That\u2019s ok, take your time and pause the video if you need.

These moves include a combination of eccentric (lengthening), concentric (shortening), and isometric (holding) contractions.

It is vital in maintaining optimal posture during cycling and running in addition to water position in swimming. In this first session, we introduce some basic movements that focus on the activation and stabilization of posterior chain muscles. These moves include a combination of eccentric (lengthening), concentric (shortening), and isometric (holding) contractions. They provide your body with the foundation for more demanding moves to come. This is also a good session to come back to if you feel like you could use a quick posterior chain activation or tune-up.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?

It introduces the most basic versions of moves that make up the majority of this program. Some of these moves may seem very basic but we encourage you to focus on perfect form and execution during these early levels so that when we turn up the heat you have things nailed. As you\u0027ll see, all the exercises at the lower levels will progress in a similar fashion going forward. We\u0027re building strength, but also fine-tuning your nervous system. As the program progresses you\u0027ll be asked to complete more difficult variations on each foundational move.\n\n\u200B\n\nAs with all the strength training routines, it helps if you\u2019ve done a warm-up before getting started. That can be one of your favorite yoga routines, riding your bike on the trainer for 5-10 minutes, or doing a personal stretching routine.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?

It introduces the most basic versions of moves that make up the majority of this program. Some of these moves may seem very basic but we encourage you to focus on perfect form and execution during these early levels so that when we turn up the heat you have things nailed. As you\u0027ll see, all the exercises at the lower levels will progress in a similar fashion going forward. We\u0027re building strength, but also fine-tuning your nervous system. As the program progresses you\u0027ll be asked to complete more difficult variations on each foundational move.\n\n\u200B\n\nAs with all the strength training routines, it helps if you\u2019ve done a warm-up before getting started. That can be one of your favorite yoga routines, riding your bike on the trainer for 5-10 minutes, or doing a personal stretching routine.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?

Clearly, you can handle a lot -- so things are going to get pretty heavy from here on out as we increase the difficulty of the moves, the duration of the interval, and the number of the sets. As you move through this session, really focus on keeping full control of your movements. You can only build strength in the muscles you can control. Also - because of the additional load, it\u0027s important that you\u2019ve followed the progression and mastered the foundational exercises in the previous levels.

Our Full Body Strength series is exactly what you\u2019re after, offering a well-rounded series of exercises that covers the lower body, core, posterior chain, and upper body. With a substantial progression, there\u2019s enough here to keep you busy -- and improving -- for a very long time._\n\n\u200B\n\nThis is the first routine in the Full Body series. It introduces the most basic versions of moves that make up the majority of this program. Some of these moves may seem very basic but we encourage you to focus on perfect form and execution during these early levels so that when we turn up the heat you have things nailed. As you\u0027ll see, all the exercises at the lower levels will progress in a similar fashion going forward. We\u0027re building strength, but also fine-tuning your nervous system. As the program progresses you\u0027ll be asked to complete more difficult variations on each foundational move.\n\n\u200B\n\nAs with all the strength training routines, it helps if you\u2019ve done a warm-up before getting started. That can be one of your favorite yoga routines, riding your bike on the trainer for 5-10 minutes, or doing a personal stretching routine.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?

It introduces the most basic versions of moves that make up the majority of this program. Some of these moves may seem very basic but we encourage you to focus on perfect form and execution during these early levels so that when we turn up the heat you have things nailed. As you\u0027ll see, all the exercises at the lower levels will progress in a similar fashion going forward. We\u0027re building strength, but also fine-tuning your nervous system. As the program progresses you\u0027ll be asked to complete more difficult variations on each foundational move.\n\n\u200B\n\nAs with all the strength training routines, it helps if you\u2019ve done a warm-up before getting started.

It introduces the most basic versions of moves that make up the majority of this program. Some of these moves may seem very basic but we encourage you to focus on perfect form and execution during these early levels so that when we turn up the heat you have things nailed. As you\u0027ll see, all the exercises at the lower levels will progress in a similar fashion going forward. We\u0027re building strength, but also fine-tuning your nervous system. As the program progresses you\u0027ll be asked to complete more difficult variations on each foundational move.\n\n\u200B\n\nAs with all the strength training routines, it helps if you\u2019ve done a warm-up before getting started.

It introduces the most basic versions of moves that make up the majority of this program. Some of these moves may seem very basic but we encourage you to focus on perfect form and execution during these early levels so that when we turn up the heat you have things nailed. As you\u0027ll see, all the exercises at the lower levels will progress in a similar fashion going forward. We\u0027re building strength, but also fine-tuning your nervous system. As the program progresses you\u0027ll be asked to complete more difficult variations on each foundational move.\n\n\u200B\n\nAs with all the strength training routines, it helps if you\u2019ve done a warm-up before getting started.
