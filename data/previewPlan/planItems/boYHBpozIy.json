As a National Champion on the track himself, and having coached countless track athletes, Neal\u0027s happy to introduce you to the boards with a series of challenges. You\u0027ll start with a little paceline work to ease into things (yes, you\u0027ll have to take your pulls). It gets more difficult from there, as you\u0027ll need to try to lap the group before hitching a ride with a multiple National and World Champion. You\u0027ll finish it off, of course, with a massive Kilometer effort.\n\n\u200B\n\nIn between, you\u0027ll learn a bit more about how Neal spends his recovery time, from gardening to family walks to time spent in his very own chill-out room.\n\n\u200B\n\n**When to ride: Do this on day 5 of the 7-day plan.**\n\n\u200B\n\n_About: Neal Henderson is one of the most accomplished coaches in cycling and multi-sport. His athletes have won more than 50 World Championships, set numerous world and national records, captured Olympic medals, worn leaders jerseys, and won stages in races like the Tour de France. Neal, a former professional triathlete, has won numerous Coach of the Year awards throughout his career from organizations like the US Olympic Committee, USA Cycling and USA Triathlon.

While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are just times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right! Most people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022\n\n\u200B\n\nTruth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted. So what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like? For 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70% is ok, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm. Also, your RPE should be a 2-4.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster.

Low-intensity endurance work is paired with brief high-cadence neuromuscular activations to keep the nervous system awake without creating new fatigue. You\u2019ll stay well below threshold throughout, allowing your body to absorb previous hard sessions and prepare for what\u2019s ahead.\n\n\u200B\n\nSet on the peaceful roads leading to the summit of Port de la Vall d\u2019Ebo, this ride promotes circulation, technique, and mental reset. It\u2019s ideal after race days or big training blocks \u2014 a smart session that helps you recover better, so you can train harder tomorrow. No ego, no watts chasing \u2014 just intentional recovery done right.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Wahoo Route**](https://www.strava.com/activities/13996505846)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

          "description": "The goal of this workout is to help develop your baseline aerobic fitness. While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high and your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week. Shorter Endurance rides (like this one) can fit in both a hard week of training and a recovery week. That is, only if you do it right! Most people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022\n\n\u200B\n\nTruth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride, especially one under 90 minutes should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted.\n\nSo what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like? For 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70%, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in low to mid Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can; for most this is 80-90rpm. Also, your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster, but you will have to trust us on this one!
