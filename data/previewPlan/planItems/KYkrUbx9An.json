          "description": "There\u0027s no getting around the fact that this is a profoundly unpleasant session that will leave your legs feeling like jelly. This session is similar to The Trick, with a few differences. On the plus side, all of the efforts are 15-seconds shorter than those in The Trick. To make up for this, we added two more intervals to this session, bringing the total to 6. That means by the end of this session you will have plowed through 4.5-minutes of AC work.\n\nThis workout is one of the few sessions that we do NOT recommend you complete in ERG mode if you are on a smart trainer. The goal is to hold onto the highest power you can for the full 45-seconds. Inevitably in the later sets, your power will dip before you reach the end of the interval. What we want is for you to complete every effort having given everything for 45-seconds. We don\u0027t want ERG mode grinding you to a halt because you cannot maintain the (ridiculously) high power targets. Even if you drop down below FTP in the final 10-seconds of these efforts, as long as you are going flat out, you are doing it correctly.\n\nJust take this session one interval at a time, and focus on giving your all for this one effort. You can worry about the others when you get to them. If you finish this session without swearing, then you didn\u0027t go hard enough!\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n1 minute 30 seconds @ RPE -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n\n1 minute 15 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 4 -- 70% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n\n45 seconds @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C90\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n\n15 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105\n\n45 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n\n15 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 200% of FTP -- HR \u003E105\n\n1 minute 30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 6\n\nRest Between Sets: 5 minutes 15 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: N/A\n\n**Interval**\n\nEffort: 45 seconds @ RPE 9.5 -- 150% of FTP -- HR \u003E105\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n4 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n",

          "description": "The 3x25-minute sub-threshold workout is one of the most classic interval sessions out there, so prepare for a trip to the northern Painlands for this FTP-builder. The reason the 3x25 sub-threshold workout is so popular is that it is easy to follow, helps teach good pacing, and gives you a great threshold training stimulus.\n\n\u200B\n\nIn this case, you\u0027re looking at three, (roughly) 25-minute blocks at around 90% of your FTP, an effort we refer to as \u0022Sub-Threshold\u0022. Many refer to this intensity as \u0022Sweet-Spot\u0022, but we prefer Sub-Threshold, as the real key is to never let your power creep above your FTP. Staying just below threshold ensures that your effort remains at an intensity you know your body can handle but that is close to what would not be sustainable.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe only way you\u0027re going to make it through three of these efforts is if you pace yourself properly. Everyone feels just fine for the first 5 minutes of the first effort, and are often tempted to go harder. Don\u0027t be that person. More often than not, that person blows up spectacularly in the second interval, unable to finish the session. Or they have to ride that second interval at lower power, turning it into a Tempo session, which is not the goal.\n\n\u200B\n\nGetting a sense of how these efforts \u0022bite\u0022 towards the end is vital to learning how to pace yourself over longer steady-state efforts; whether that\u0027s a time trial, local climb, breakaway, triathlon, or even a good old fitness test. In each of those cases, the pacing is key. Learning how your perceived effort can steadily climb even though your power remains unchanged is critical to good pacing.\n\n\u200B\n\nSo how do you know if you are doing this one right? As we said, the first 5 minutes should feel relatively easy. Around that 5-minute mark, your heart rate should stop climbing, and settle into 2-5% below your Lactate Threshold Heart Rate (LTHR). If your heart rate is climbing for the entire effort and goes above your LTHR, then you are going too hard.\n\nIf you hit the 10-minute mark, your legs feel fine, and your heart rate is still in Zone 3, then you aren\u0027t going hard enough.\n\nIf you\u0027ve never done a session like this before, you can consider only doing the first 20-minute effort, or even sticking to just the first 15 minutes of each effort. There\u0027s no shame in building up to this full session, so don\u0027t be afraid to pause and fast forward as needed.\n\n\u200B\n\nNailing this session is really about getting in tune with your body and understanding what the edge between a sustainable and an unsustainable effort feels like. Not being able to complete this workout is fairly common, so don\u0027t beat yourself up if you can\u0027t make it through the first few times. As long as you come away from this session with a better understanding of how to pace longer efforts, you\u0027ve improved as an athlete.\n",

But if you\u2019re going to travel around globe stealing crowns from some of the world\u2019s fastest climbers, you need to bring your A-game.\n\n\u200B\n\nIn this short, 35-minute workout, Phil takes you through a warm-up on the famous Pacific Coast Highway before climbing into two short, maximal efforts on the way up Dekker Canyon. You\u2019ll be in the hurt box, but be sure to pay attention as Phil drops his top tips for KOM / QOM segment success.\n\n\u200B\n\nIn between efforts, Phil keeps you entertained with stories about his Cookie Fondo, life in LA, a tour of his garage, a face lick from his dog and his personal recommendation for the best cold-pressed juice in town.\n\n\u200B\n\n_Do this on: Day 3 of the 5-day plan._\n",

          "description": "The Col de Braus workout focuses on maintaining a consistent tempo while responding to varied efforts, mimicking real race scenarios. This dynamic training session designed to build endurance and power with a series of specific tempo and surge efforts starts out with a steady tempo pace. At the 2 km mark, we will engage in a 90-second effort as if responding to a breakaway, then return to a strong threshold pace as the profile dips. Throughout the ride, the focus will be on maintaining a high tempo, incorporating ten 3-minute efforts with 30-second out-of-the-saddle bursts.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/11556448551)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

As we depart the village of Mandelieu-la-Napoule and hug the Mediterranean coastline, we\u2019ll kick things off with a series of cadence pyramids. Although these in an of themselves may not feel overly taxing, as we head inland the fun really starts as Mike guides you through a series of threshold efforts with bursts on the striking red roads of l\u2019Est\u00E9rel, all the way to the summit of the Col Notre Dame. As we delve deeper into the many highlights of the area\u2014from the historic villages that line the coast to the ritz and glitz of Cannes\u2014we\u2019re definitely going to be working up a sweat here. Luckily, we\u0027ll be finishing up with a visit to the famous Galimard perfumery.
