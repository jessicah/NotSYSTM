          "description": "One of the best sessions for neuromuscular training, this drill asks you to progressively build from a cadence of 90 RPM to your MAX over 30 seconds, recover, and repeat several times. Cadence builds improve how you recruit your leg, gluteal, and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke by progressing to your maximal cadence. By reaching your highest cadence possible, you are training the \u0027on/off\u0027 switch in each muscle group to not only work faster but to have less overlap with your other muscle groups. This session trains your hamstring muscles to \u0027turn off\u0027 when your quads \u0027turn on\u0027 and vice-versa, resulting in a more efficient pedal stroke at both high and low cadences.\n\n\u200B\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to The Knowledge podcast, by Wahoo Sports Science - The Benefits of High Cadence Training: [https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence](https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence)\n",

The first set of sprints has enough recovery that you\u0027ll be able to work your NM to the max. The second set still has enough recovery to allow you to hit high power numbers, but the reduced time between sprints stresses your ability to recover and repeat that high effort. That means you\u0027ll start to dip into AC. The last set\u2014with equal sprint and recovery times\u2014ensures your heart rate never gets a chance to drop down. That works your MAP like nobody\u0027s business.\n",

          "description": "You can never have too many tools in the shed. After years of lobbying, we finally convinced Grunter von Agony to share his favorite set of implements with us: the fabled _14 Vise Grips_. Taken individually, each of the 14 intervals might appear tame, incapable of inflicting a significant squeeze. But when expertly applied in the correct order, they apply just the right kind of pressure to turn a Couchlandrian into a Sufferlandrian, just like turning coal into diamonds.\n\n\u200B\n\nWhile the duration of each Vise Grip varies (from 30 seconds to 2 minutes), the power targets and recovery durations between them remain constant. The first 30-second interval should feel like a Sunday stroll in the park, but by the end of the first 2-minute Vise Grip, you\u0027ll be cursing Grunter\u0027s name. As the intervals get shorter, time will appear to stretch. That final 30-second effort will feel like an eternity. When you roll up to the second set, you\u0027ll know what you\u0027re in for, so just put your head down and prepare yourself to crush or be crushed.\n\n\u200B\n\nOnce you make it through all 14 Vise Grips, you will have been north of your Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) for a total of 16 minutes. Changing the duration of the efforts (while keeping the same recovery) stresses your Anaerobic Capacity (AC) in a more dynamic way than, say, a more straightforward on/off session like _Half is Easy_. Since the longer efforts have the same recovery duration as the shorter ones, you will eventually deplete your AC, forcing your body to rely on your MAP to hit the required power targets. As the intervals get shorter in the second half of each set, you\u0027ll find that you have just enough left in the tank to complete the next effort.\n\n\u200B\n\nUltimately this workout combines the advantages of shorter, higher-power intervals with longer recovery (great for building muscular strength) with the advantages of longer, higher-power intervals with inadequate recovery (great for driving up your MAP and improving your AC).\n",

You would be right. That\u0027s why we would never do something as crazy as letting you start the 2nd set from The Shovel fresh. Instead, you get to be the Nail for the first 3 efforts from Nine Hammers. Once you\u0027ve done that and wrapped up that second set from The Shovel, all that stands between you and that massive pit of exhaustion and GLORY are 2 more Hammers. Did we mention they were Hammers 8 and 9? No? Good, good. Forget we said anything. Just pretend you have 3 Hammers and 1 Shovel to contend with. Those last 2 Hammers are \u0022Future You\u0027s\u0022 problem - let that chump deal with the nightmare.\n\n\u200B\n\nWhen asking, \u0022will this make me faster?\u0022 the answer is YES (and, at least in the short term, quite miserable). _The Shovel_ packs a massive Anaerobic Capacity (AC) punch, with inverse-micro intervals that dish out ever higher the power the shorter the interval. While_ Nine Hammers_ packs a huge MAP/FTP punch, it also helps drive up your sustained power regardless of your rider type or weakness. Facing the first 3 hammers gives your aerobic (MAP/FTP) system a hefty load to deal with and will just about fully deplete your AC stores, which makes this the perfect time to start the 2nd set from _The Shovel_. With depleted reserves, starting with the short 5 second sprints ensures that you are just fresh enough to push your NM system but fatigued enough that your AC never fully recovers for the duration of these intervals. With your AC depleted, heart rate pegged, and breathing rate through the roof, the last thing you WANT is the final 2 hammers. This isn\u0027t about what you want, though. It\u0027s about what you need.\n\n\u200B\n\nBy the time you start this set of hammers, your top-end power will be feeling completely drained; any \u0022snap\u0022 you might usually rely on to make it through these 3-4 minute efforts will be long gone. That means you are facing down the final 2 hammers relying solely on your MAP and FTP. The higher your FTP, the faster you will recover, and the higher your MAP, the greater the punishment you can handle. Once you pick yourself up off the floor from hammers 8 and 9, you will have pushed your body to its absolute limits across almost every 4DP Metric, which will send you down the path to be a faster and more badass Sufferlandrian.\n",

Well, now\u0027s your chance. _Getting Away With It_ gets you out of the office and onto the roads of the French Pyrenees with your guide Michael Cotty of The Col Collective.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis is a great session to add toward the end of a training block. The shorter duration, sub-threshold efforts are fantastic for getting some extra FTP building while you are in a fatigued state. Extra emphasis on cadence stresses your nervous system, making your body more efficient at higher and lower RPMs while improving your form. The Neuromuscular training you get from this session is fantastic, so while your power never exceeds threshold, your body will learn to bring more energy to the pedals at all intensities.\n",

We\u2019ve taken the first-person camera footage and power data from a pro cyclist and analyzed it to determine which part of their 4DP\u00AE profile each of their efforts corresponds to. But since few of us can put down pro-level watts, we made it so all of the efforts are scaled to your own personal 4DP\u00AE profile. That means you get to experience exactly what the pros experience relative to your own abilities. When they sprint, you sprint. When they attack, you attack.

A small country in the Balkan Peninsula that hides some of the most beautiful natural wonders and unique cultural heritage in this part of the world. Yet it remains unknown to many. Only the alternative, curious and brave plan their journeys in this hidden gem. However, a small self-organized crew from Serbia and Germany set a mission to discover and reveal those stunning natural creations of Serbia. On a bicycle. In just five days, they traversed 450 kilometers across six mountains of Western Serbia, and climbed around 11,000 meters to film and produce what you are about to experience.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: This is a great way to watch a compelling documentary while developing your baseline aerobic fitness.

This one, however is a little less focused on Anaerobic Capacity and a little more on muscle endurance, due to that big blue block in the middle. The first pyramid will begin to fatigue your muscles and tax your AC before you face 20 minutes at tempo. With both of those efforts under your belt, the second pyramid will drain the rest of your AC and ask your aerobic system to pick up the slack. This might even feel similar to a mountain bike or cyclocross race effort- you take it out hard, jockeying for the hole shot or a front pack position before getting into the technical elements. Then you settle into a sustainable effort for a short while, maybe working with a couple others before battling it out for your final finishing position.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n9 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4 -- 70% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n**Build x3**\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n1 minute 30 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of sets: 2\n\nRest between sets: 20 minutes @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR \u003C100\n\nInterval repeats per set: 1\n\n**Interval **\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 200% of FTP -- \u003E105%\n\n50 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 9.5 -- 180% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n40 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 150% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n40 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n50 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n50 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n40 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 150% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 9.5 -- 180% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n40 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 200% of FTP -- \u003E105%\n\n7 minutes 30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume **\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down **\n\n10 minutes 40 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n",

          "description": "While some of you will know this intensity level as \u0022Sweet-Spot\u0022, we prefer the name Sub-Threshold, because we want to drive home the fact that you should keep your power below FTP. In the same way that longer Tempo efforts can feel \u0022easy,\u0022 these shorter Sub-Threshold efforts can also feel \u0022easy\u0022. After all, if you can hold 100% of FTP for about an hour, then holding less than that for 8 minutes should be a piece of cake right? We know you can go harder for this short amount of time, but that is not what we are asking for.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session is not intended to push you to your limits, nor is it designed to be a massive training load. The real purpose is to essentially keep your fatigue levels right where they are, by giving your body just enough intensity to ensure that you are not \u0022more recovered\u0022 after today.\n\n\u200B\n\nWhile some folks will say that there is no training benefit to such short Sub-Threshold efforts, when viewed in a bigger picture sense (like a 3-week training block) they can be the perfect efforts to ensure you get the most out of a longer training block.\n\n\u200B\n\nWe would even ask that you view this session as more of an assessment, rather than strictly a workout. That\u0027s because you should be comparing this power output to heart rate response and your own internal RPE. When you have heavy fatigue, your heart rate will struggle to hit its normal peaks. When fresh you would be getting into Z4 heart rate by the end of the last two intervals, and your RPE should never really climb above a 7. When holding onto excess fatigue, your heart rate won\u0027t climb above Z3, and your RPE will be above an 8. At the same time, if you have gained a significant amount of fitness, your Heart Rate will stay in Z3, and your RPE won\u0027t climb above 6. The secondary tell between improved fitness and fatigue is how quickly your heart rate drops after each effort. When fatigued, your heart rate won\u0027t drop below Z2 during the recovery.\n\n\u200B\n\nWhile it is easy to rely solely on Power, you should always refer back to RPE and Heart Rate, and today is the perfect session to practice comparing the 3.\n\n\u200B\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C85%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C95%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 90-95% of AC (130-180% of FTP)\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 4\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 4\n\n**Interval**\n\nSurge: 30 sec @ RPE 8.5 -- 90% of MAP (105-130% of FTP)\n\nSteady: 1 minutes 30 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 90% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n13 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C85%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- \u003C45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

This session is similar to The Trick, with a few differences. On the plus side, all of the efforts are 15-seconds shorter than those in The Trick. To make up for this, we added two more intervals to this session, bringing the total to 6. That means by the end of this session you will have plowed through 4.5-minutes of AC work.\n\nThis workout is one of the few sessions that we do NOT recommend you complete in ERG mode if you are on a smart trainer. The goal is to hold onto the highest power you can for the full 45-seconds. Inevitably in the later sets, your power will dip before you reach the end of the interval. What we want is for you to complete every effort having given everything for 45-seconds. We don\u0027t want ERG mode grinding you to a halt because you cannot maintain the (ridiculously) high power targets. Even if you drop down below FTP in the final 10-seconds of these efforts, as long as you are going flat out, you are doing it correctly.\n\nJust take this session one interval at a time, and focus on giving your all for this one effort.

          "description": "This workout combines several technique driven intervals. These will improve your overall form and efficiency on the bike. The first two drills, Cadence Holds and Builds, are designed to improve the way you recruit your leg, glute and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke. They do this by forcing you to sustain a cadence just above \u0027comfortable\u0027 and by pushing you to your maximal cadence.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe last drill, Single Leg Efforts, ask you to unclip one leg and ride at a steady, single-legged effort. This forces you to pull up on the pedal instead of just pushing down and ensures maximal muscle awareness and engagement. This workout is best done while riding indoors on a trainer because even small variations in terrain can affect your ability to properly execute this workout. The majority of this workout is done in heart rate Z1/2 /// 50-75% of threshold /// RPE 2-5. You should keep the effort level below threshold (heart rate Z4, 100% of threshold, RPE 7-8) during the max cadence efforts.\n\n\u200B\n\nWORKOUT GOALS:\n\n- To improve stillness and stability at high cadences.\n- To improve muscle fiber engagement for improved efficiency at all cadences.\n- To increase maximum cadence.\n- To make that pedal stroke as smooth as butter.\n\nCADENCE TARGETS:\n\n- Warm-up 80-90rpm\n- Build: 90-150rpm\n- Hold: 115rpm\n- Single Leg: 85rpm\n\nListen to The Knowledge podcast, by Wahoo Sports Science - The Benefits of High Cadence Training: [https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence](https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n3 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 3\n\nRest Between Sets: 8 minutes @ RPE 23 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: N/A\n\n**Interval**\n\nCadence Build: 30 seconds @ RPE 8 -- Starting at 90RPM Build to Max RPM -- Max Power is NOT Goal\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nCadence Hold: 45 seconds @ RPE 7.5 -- \u003C100% FTP -- Highest RPM you can hold without Bouncing\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nSingle Leg: 1 minute @ RPE 6 -- Single Leg Only -- \u003C50% of FTP\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nSingle Leg: 1 minute @ RPE 6 -- Single Leg Only, Opposite Leg -- \u003C50% of FTP (100% of FTP with both legs = 50% of FTP\n\nwith one leg)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n8 minutes 15 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

Originally created in Coach Sir Neal Henderson\u0027s Penn State dorm room in 1992, it\u0027s his weapon of choice for bringing the pain (shakes).\n\n\u200B\n\nWhat\u0027s in the Blender? First, a variety of longer efforts build sustained power while also making sure you\u0027re sufficiently fatigued. This initial beatdown is necessary to ensure you get the maximum benefit from _Blender_\u0027s infamous \u0027Pain Shakes.\u0027 Three sets of these little devils help you develop a supernatural ability to recover from big efforts. The bonus is that you also beef up your ability to produce high-end power, building Anaerobic Capacity and Maximal Aerobic Power simultaneously.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe threshold efforts at the end are the bitter cherry on the sundae, improving your body\u0027s ability to produce aerobic power and helping make sure your FTP will get the same boost as your AC and MAP. A rising tide of lactic acid raises all boats. Oh, and clocking in at one hour and 40 minutes, Blender will also help whip your endurance into a frenzy.\n",

The blend between mind and body, working together to overcome hard moments\u2014be it physical, mental or emotional\u2014and how we learn to cope in our own mind is essential in being able to process the past, be true to ourselves in the present, and create moments of inner peace in the future.\n\n\u200B\n\nA decade after crossing the French Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es non-stop on a ride that would act as a catalyst for change, I wanted to share this story for the first time. To give an insight into the deeper meaning behind some of the mountain challenges you may have seen me undertake over the years, I felt now was the time to head back to my mountains, return to source, and embrace the unknown.\n\n\u200B\n\nOvercoming the mountains of our mind, from escapism to reconnection. 10 years, 10 cols and 10,000 meters of climbing. This is my story of going Full Circle.\n\n\u200B\n\nThank you for watching. I truly hope there is something in this video that can help you in your own journey.\n\n\u200B\n\nPeace,\n\nMike Cotty\u0022\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: The workout accompanying this film is a recovery session, which is a very low-intensity ride. It\u0027s so easy that your power remains at or below 50% of FTP or an RPE less than 2.5, and your heart rate stays in zone 1 the entire time. The intensity and cadence targets will vary throughout this session to keep it interesting (But not so interesting that you can\u0027t pay attention to the film).\n",

While it\u0027s not as comprehensive or as accurate as our main fitness test, _Full Frontal_, it\u0027s far more approachable and easier to pace for new riders. It also doesn\u0027t require any special preparation. You just need to feel relatively fresh.\n\n\u200B\n\nBased on more than a year of research (and after dozens of lab tests and thousands of online tests) and using sophisticated analysis of power and heart rate data, _Half Monty_ is far more accurate and comprehensive than standard ramp tests.\n\n\u200B\n\nIt also tells you more about who you are as an athlete. _Half Monty_ provides you with your FTP, Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP), and Cycling Threshold Heart Rate (cTHR), all of which we use to personalize your workout targets.\n\n\u200B\n\nIf you\u0027re still using the 4DP estimates when you set up your account, _Half Monty_ will also refine your AC and NM estimates (but will not do so if you\u0027ve done _Full Frontal_ or manually adjusted your estimates). If you want fully accurate AC and NM, as well as your Rider Type, Strengths, Weaknesses, and training plans adjusted to those Strengths and Weaknesses, you\u0027ll need to expose yourself to the _Full Frontal_ 4DP fitness test.\n\n\u200B\n\nReady to climb the ramp? You\u0027ll need the following before you start:\n\n- A heart rate monitor if you want the most accurate results. Don\u0027t have one? Order one [HERE](https://wahoofitness.com/devices)\n- Some kind of power device connected (trainer, power meter, virtual power, etc.)\n- Be ready to pay close attention to the instructions in the workout\n- Be sure your profile is complete and up-to-date (Profile \u003E About You). Accurate information helps us make our calculations\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to \u0027[Why Fitness Testing Matters](https://the-knowledge-by-wahoo-sports-science.simplecast.com/episodes/testing-testing-1-2-3-why-fitness-testing-matters)\u0027 on The Knowledge Podcast by Wahoo Sports Science.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s some more information on how to get the most from your fitness test.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterFitnessAssessment)\n",

As national news of the unfortunate event breaks, the team are left wondering if they\u0027ll be able to compete or if this becomes a home visit to forget.

We\u2019ve taken the first-person camera footage and power data from a pro cyclist and analyzed it to determine which part of their 4DP\u00AE profile each of their efforts corresponds to. But since few of us can put down pro-level watts, we made it so all of the efforts are scaled to your own personal 4DP\u00AE profile. That means you get to experience exactly what the pros experience relative to your own abilities. When they sprint, you sprint. When they attack, you attack. When they sit up, you get to take it (relatively) easy. It\u0027s the most immersive, realistic race simulation out there.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s some more information on how to create the most immersive ProRides experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterProRides)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Featured Footage: **Velon\n",

It trains your ability to generate force through the pedals by ensuring you recruit ALL of your muscles to get those cranks turning. No matter your preferred discipline, these efforts are key to teaching your body to recruit all of the muscle fibers in your legs.\n\n\u200B\n\nAll of the benefits in this session come from hitting these 20-second efforts as hard as you possibly can. To do that, you need full recovery between each sprint, and you need to respect that recovery. These efforts should see you start at super low RPMs with very high torque. As you start and increase the effort, your cadence will naturally increase. **Your goal is to get your cadence as high as possible by the end of each 20-second effort.** To maximize your muscle recruitment, you want to both push down and pull up on the pedals at the start. Proper core engagement is a must - your legs need a good strong backboard to push against.\n\n\u200B\n\nWe understand that not everyone\u0027s trainer has the necessary resistance or the required stability to perform this workout as described. If you can\u0027t safely stand up, then you can get much of the same benefit by doing these efforts seated. If your trainer can\u2019t handle the rapid change in speed or does not have high enough resistance at a super low cadence, then you can start the efforts at a higher cadence and treat them as \u201Cnormal\u201D all-out sprints.\n",

Generally, tapering means reducing your total training volume but continuing to hit some high-intensity efforts. While there are individual variations in the best way to taper, this session has been used by countless professionals leading into the biggest races of their lives -- athletes like World Champions Rohan Dennis and Flora Duffy.\n\n\u200B\n\nWith 3 sets of micro-intervals (40/20s, 30/30s, and 20/40s) you will hit your system with just enough intensity to keep your legs sharp and responsive, without adding any real fatigue. Outside of those 3 sets of micro-intervals, this session is purposefully short and easy. This is a preparation session, not a training session! After all, your event is just around the corner and all of the important training is behind you. Riding harder or longer today will do absolutely nothing to increase your fitness by event day; in fact, all that would do is increase your fatigue, which will only hurt your performance.

The key to this session is having you spend just enough time right around threshold, with sufficient recovery between efforts and a handful of sprints to prime all of your systems for tomorrow\u0027s event.  \n",

Developed by Head of Wahoo Sports Science Coach Neal Henderson, Full Frontal uses the same lab-verified testing protocol that Coach Neal has used at the highest level for over a decade with professional and amateur athletes.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis test will provide you with a complete Four-Dimensional Power profile, identify your Rider Type, and tell you exactly what aspects of your fitness you need to focus on to become a more complete cyclist. More importantly, SYSTM will then use your results to set personalized power targets for all of your workouts based on your unique profile, resulting in the most precise, effective workouts available. Your results will also be used to tailor all of your training plans.\n\n\u200B\n\nWe recommend re-testing with Full Frontal every 8-12 weeks or as prescribed by your training plan.\n\n\u200B\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to \u0027[Why Fitness Testing Matters](https://the-knowledge-by-wahoo-sports-science.simplecast.com/episodes/testing-testing-1-2-3-why-fitness-testing-matters)\u0027 on The Knowledge Podcast by Wahoo Sports Science\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s some more information on how to get the most from your fitness test.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterFitnessAssessment)\n",

The session begins with a calming breathing technique, followed by a simple foot massage to introduce movement from the toes up to the heel. With increased range of motion, the routine progresses to gentle, dynamic stretches for the calves, hamstrings, and hips. Since feet are often neglected and subjected to high demands from activities like running or cycling, practicing this sequence at least once a week helps to rebalance and address this issue.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe objectives are to improve mobility in the feet and ankles, stretch the calves and hamstrings, and open up the hips.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Poses in this session:**\n\n- Easy Seat\n- Box Breathing\n- Foot Massage\n- Downward Dog\n- Screaming Toe\n- Yoga Squat\n- Ankle Stretch\n- Ankle Mobilisations\n- Windscreen Wipers\n",

This includes everything from your powerful glutes, hamstrings, and calves to the postural muscles of your upper back and neck._\n\n\u200B\n\nYour posterior chain is responsible for back and hip extension as well as knee flexion. It is vital in maintaining optimal posture during cycling and running in addition to water position in swimming. In this first session, we introduce some basic movements that focus on the activation and stabilization of posterior chain muscles. These moves include a combination of eccentric (lengthening), concentric (shortening), and isometric (holding) contractions. They provide your body with the foundation for more demanding moves to come.

The result? Improved core strength, stability, and endurance. You\u0027ll find exercises that carry over into other areas of your body, but all of the moves have a significant impact on your core. Level 1 is ideal for very beginners. Even then, you may find some of these moves challenging if you have never attempted them. That\u2019s ok, take your time and pause the video if you need. Soon you\u2019ll be on your way to mastering your core potential.

The goal is not to develop big muscles in your arms and chest, but to build basic functional strength to help you improve stability and become a more well-rounded athlete.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis extra work is derived from more difficult variations of the foundation moves. While the added upper-body component will decrease the number of reps you can complete in a set, your primary goal remains to nail perfect form. Even though you\u0027ve been at this for several weeks your nervous system is still learning these movement patterns.

So nicely, in fact, that you\u2019re ready for a more demanding session. This workout includes compound sets which are more difficult but, most importantly, more beneficial than simply doing more sets of a single move. This is because your nervous system has to work overtime to cope with the variety. The number of reps per set is also higher, which will help drive continuous improvement.\n\n\u200B\n\nSince this is a longer session, you may experience considerable fatigue on your first time through. As a result, pay more attention to your form. Your body will want to use as little energy as possible, which can lead to some bad habits when hitting rep after rep of a single move. Thankfully, the constant variation of the compound sets forces you to stay engaged and helps you keep solid form from start to finish.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?

Our Full Body Strength series is exactly what you\u2019re after, offering a well-rounded series of exercises that covers the lower body, core, posterior chain, and upper body. With a substantial progression, there\u2019s enough here to keep you busy -- and improving -- for a very long time._\n\n\u200B\n\nThis is the first routine in the Full Body series. It introduces the most basic versions of moves that make up the majority of this program. Some of these moves may seem very basic but we encourage you to focus on perfect form and execution during these early levels so that when we turn up the heat you have things nailed. As you\u0027ll see, all the exercises at the lower levels will progress in a similar fashion going forward. We\u0027re building strength, but also fine-tuning your nervous system. As the program progresses you\u0027ll be asked to complete more difficult variations on each foundational move.\n\n\u200B\n\nAs with all the strength training routines, it helps if you\u2019ve done a warm-up before getting started. That can be one of your favorite yoga routines, riding your bike on the trainer for 5-10 minutes, or doing a personal stretching routine.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?

With a substantial progression, there\u2019s enough here to keep you busy -- and improving -- for a very long time._\n\n\u200B\n\nThis is the first routine in the Full Body series. It introduces the most basic versions of moves that make up the majority of this program. Some of these moves may seem very basic but we encourage you to focus on perfect form and execution during these early levels so that when we turn up the heat you have things nailed. As you\u0027ll see, all the exercises at the lower levels will progress in a similar fashion going forward. We\u0027re building strength, but also fine-tuning your nervous system. As the program progresses you\u0027ll be asked to complete more difficult variations on each foundational move.\n\n\u200B\n\nAs with all the strength training routines, it helps if you\u2019ve done a warm-up before getting started. That can be one of your favorite yoga routines, riding your bike on the trainer for 5-10 minutes, or doing a personal stretching routine.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?

Level 4 will not disappoint in terms of overloading your chest, back, shoulders, arms, and core.

              "description": "_Want a strength training routine that covers all the bases? Our Full Body Strength series is exactly what you\u2019re after, offering a well-rounded series of exercises that covers the lower body, core, posterior chain, and upper body. With a substantial progression, there\u2019s enough here to keep you busy -- and improving -- for a very long time._\n\n\u200B\n\nThis is the first routine in the Full Body series. It introduces the most basic versions of moves that make up the majority of this program. Some of these moves may seem very basic but we encourage you to focus on perfect form and execution during these early levels so that when we turn up the heat you have things nailed. As you\u0027ll see, all the exercises at the lower levels will progress in a similar fashion going forward. We\u0027re building strength, but also fine-tuning your nervous system. As the program progresses you\u0027ll be asked to complete more difficult variations on each foundational move.\n\n\u200B\n\nAs with all the strength training routines, it helps if you\u2019ve done a warm-up before getting started. That can be one of your favorite yoga routines, riding your bike on the trainer for 5-10 minutes, or doing a personal stretching routine.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?

This keeps your body adapted while allowing it to fully recover. To make the most out of your strength gains, you need to balance the hard work with adequate recovery.
