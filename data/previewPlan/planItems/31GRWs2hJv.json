But it\u0027s not all hard work. Along the way, Phil\u2019s going to share his love for LA, tell stories from his time in the pro peloton, introduce you to his crew, and maybe even make you a cookie or two.\n\n\u200B\n\n_Day 1/5: Introduction_\n\n_Day 2/5: Openers_\n\n_Day 3/5: Short KOM Training Session_\n\n_Day 4/5: Neighborhood Ride_\n\n_Day 5/5: Long KOM Training Session_\n",

To get you ready, Phil is taking us over to the iconic Griffith Park in the Santa Monica mountains for a session of \u2018Openers.\u2019 These efforts will get your body ready for the workouts you have coming up without generating any real fatigue.\n\n\u200B\n\nDuring the warm-up, Phil gives a history lesson on the park, explains how his career developed, his connection to Quentin Tarantino and points out all of the world-famous museums that he has never set foot in.\n\n\u200B\n\nIn between intervals, Phil takes you behind-the-scenes of his many side hustles and explains why and how he started his different business ventures. As we wrap up the session it\u2019s time for a little post-ride treat: some homemade cookies baked by the man himself.\n\n\u200B\n\n_Do this on: Day 2 of the 5-day plan._\n",

To help uncover some of LA\u2019s hidden treasures, Phil asked his fiance, Emily, to join him to peel back the curtain on the secret history behind the streets and homes of their neighborhood. But be ready to bust out your flannel shirt and comb out that mustache. When the tarmac ends, we\u2019re going gravel grinding on the famous Mulholland Drive.\n\n\u200B\n\nAlong the way, Phil and Emily discuss murder, celebrity homes, where AA batteries were first invented, how to talk like a real gravel grinder, and the sweet victory of finding fresh oranges on the curb mid-ride. You\u0027ll finish the day off with lunch at one of their favorite local cafes and a tour of their personal Cycling Museum.\n\n\u200B\n\n_Do this on: Day 4 of the 5-day plan._\n",
