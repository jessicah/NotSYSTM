  "description": "Welcome to the Mobility and Stability Series.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis series of workouts are designed to enhance your joint mobility \u0026 stability and improve circulation and muscular activation. The sessions are divided into four areas of focus, Neck (Cervical), Shoulder \u0026 Upper Back (Thoracic Spine), Core (Trunk) \u0026 Hip, and Foot \u0026 Ankle.\n\n\u200B\n\nThese routines are NOT meant to be progressive. Rather, each session provides a slightly different way of improving mobility in the targeted area.\n\n\u200B\n\nPlease take your time as you work through the sessions and remember that you should never move into or push through pain. Go at your own pace and feel free to repeat any of the moves if you like.\n",
