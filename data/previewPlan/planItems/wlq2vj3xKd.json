          "description": "Over/under intervals, where you alternate going just below and just above threshold, are the foundation of many classic workouts. Cash Register is an adaptation of that idea and comes in the format of a sprint/settle/surge session consisting of 4 intervals that get a little shorter (but not easier) each round.\n\n\u200B\n\nEach interval kicks off with a sprint effort that targets your Neuromuscular (NM) power. Then you settle into a controlled, below-FTP effort that will accelerate the rate at which you can clear lactate from your muscles. You\u0027ll finish each effort off with a big surge based on your Anaerobic Capacity (AC). In just 30 minutes, you\u0027ll be doing efforts targeting your sprint power, FTP, and AC for an exceptionally well-rounded workout.\n\n\u200B\n\nSupport the Wahooligan Tour by [donating to the Davis Phinney Foundation](https://secure2.convio.net/dpf/site/TR?pg=pfind\u0026fr_id=1391) and their programs to help people living with Parkinsons.\n",

You\u0027ll start with a little paceline work to ease into things (yes, you\u0027ll have to take your pulls). It gets more difficult from there, as you\u0027ll need to try to lap the group before hitching a ride with a multiple National and World Champion. You\u0027ll finish it off, of course, with a massive Kilometer effort.\n\n\u200B\n\nIn between, you\u0027ll learn a bit more about how Neal spends his recovery time, from gardening to family walks to time spent in his very own chill-out room.\n\n\u200B\n\n**When to ride: Do this on day 5 of the 7-day plan.**\n\n\u200B\n\n_About: Neal Henderson is one of the most accomplished coaches in cycling and multi-sport.

          "description": "With short near-maximal sprint efforts like these, you\u0027ll recruit all of the muscle fibers in your legs. While cadence builds force your muscles to contract and relax as quickly as possible, this session forces your muscles to contract with maximal power. Just like cadence builds, this session becomes one of the best ways to train your neuromuscular system.\n\n\u200B\n\nEven if your target event does not require you to complete maximal sprints, there is a substantial trickle-down efficiency effect to the longer duration power efforts when you train your neuromuscular system.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session is a great alternate to cadence builds or standing starts for those completing our SUF Strength sessions. On days you complete strength work you want your on bike training to complement that work. This means short maximal efforts (whether for power or for cadence) are the best workouts to complement the strength gains you\u0027ve made off the bike.\n\nYou should ride this session in Level, rather than Erg, mode. The only time we would suggest Erg mode is if you can\u2019t maintain the lower power targets set between sprints.\n\n\u200B\n\nAs long as you run this session in Level mode you can complete the sprints either seated or standing. For those competing in events that don\u2019t require much (if any) standing (such as Time Trials or Triathlons), you should complete these sprints seated (and in the aerobars or drops if that is where you are racing). You should also do these efforts seated if you don\u0027t feel an out-of-the-saddle maximal sprint is stable/safe to do on your trainer.\n\n\u200B\n\nRegardless of using ERG or Level mode, don\u2019t hold back on any sprint. Seeing your peak power drop as the session goes on is totally normal as your legs fatigue. This is where RPE really becomes the most important metric, rather than power, heart rate, or cadence.\n\n\u200B\n\nNow get on that bike and CRUSH IT!\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n4 minutes @ RPE 1 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n3 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 70% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 6 -- 90% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 1 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n5 seconds @ RPE 6 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003C90% (increase rpm by 5)\n\n5 seconds @ RPE 6 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003C90% (increase rpm by 5)\n\n5 seconds @ RPE 6 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003C90% (increase rpm by 5)\n\n5 seconds @ RPE 6 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003C90% (increase rpm by 5)\n\n1 minute @ RPE 1 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n5 seconds @ RPE 6 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003C90% (increase rpm by 5)\n\n5 seconds @ RPE 6 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003C90% (increase rpm by 5)\n\n5 seconds @ RPE 6 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003C90% (increase rpm by 5)\n\n5 seconds @ RPE 6 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003C90% (increase rpm by 5)\n\n3 minutes @ RPE 1 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of sets: 2\n\nRest between sets: 4 minutes @ RPE 1 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nInterval repeats: 4\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 180% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n50 seconds @ RPE 1 -- 40% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nNA\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n1 minute 20 seconds @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 1 -- 40% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

Intervals get harder as they get shorter, pushing your Anaerobic Capacity (AC) to the very limit and ensuring that after each micro-interval, your body recovers just enough to hit and hold your power target for the next interval...even if you don\u0027t think you can.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe 5 and 10-second efforts hit your Neuromuscular (NM) system hard. No holding back for these short efforts. All out means all out. The 15-60 second efforts all require significant anaerobic energy, but with so little rest, your cardiovascular system never really gets a break. This not only stresses your AC as you try to recover, but it also pushes your Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) to its limit as your body tries to generate as much aerobic power as possible.\n\n\u200B\n\nEven though there is no single interval in this workout that is longer than 60 seconds, each full set lasts more than 20 minutes, so the unrelenting aerobic stress turns this session into a surprisingly good FTP builder.\n",

The result? Improved core strength, stability, and endurance. You\u0027ll find exercises that carry over into other areas of your body, but all of the moves have a significant impact on your core. Level 1 is ideal for very beginners. Even then, you may find some of these moves challenging if you have never attempted them. That\u2019s ok, take your time and pause the video if you need. Soon you\u2019ll be on your way to mastering your core potential.

We\u2019ve taken the first-person camera footage and power data from a pro cyclist and analyzed it to determine which part of their 4DP\u00AE profile each of their efforts corresponds to. But since few of us can put down pro-level watts, we made it so all of the efforts are scaled to your own personal 4DP\u00AE profile. That means you get to experience exactly what the pros experience relative to your own abilities. When they sprint, you sprint. When they attack, you attack. When they sit up, you get to take it (relatively) easy.
