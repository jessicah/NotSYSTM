              "description": "One of the best sessions for neuromuscular training, this drill asks you to progressively build from a cadence of 90 RPM to your MAX over 30 seconds, recover, and repeat several times. Cadence builds improve how you recruit your leg, gluteal, and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke by progressing to your maximal cadence. By reaching your highest cadence possible, you are training the \u0027on/off\u0027 switch in each muscle group to not only work faster but to have less overlap with your other muscle groups. This session trains your hamstring muscles to \u0027turn off\u0027 when your quads \u0027turn on\u0027 and vice-versa, resulting in a more efficient pedal stroke at both high and low cadences.\n\n\u200B\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to The Knowledge podcast, by Wahoo Sports Science - The Benefits of High Cadence Training: [https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence](https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence)\n",

This session is designed to sharpen muscle activation and improve recovery after intense efforts.\n\nFinish strong, and I\u2019ll see you in Burgberg!\n\n\u200B\n\nWith short near-maximal sprint efforts like these, you\u2019ll recruit all of the muscle fibers in your legs. While cadence builds force your muscles to contract and relax as quickly as possible, this session forces your muscles to contract with maximal power. Just like cadence builds, this session becomes one of the best ways to train your neuromuscular system.\n\nEven if your target event does not require you to complete maximal sprints, there is a substantial trickle-down efficiency effect to the longer-duration power efforts when you train your neuromuscular system.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/9866624296)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

Even for an hour? Well, now\u0027s your chance. _Getting Away With It_ gets you out of the office and onto the roads of the French Pyrenees with your guide Michael Cotty of The Col Collective.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis is a great session to add toward the end of a training block. The shorter duration, sub-threshold efforts are fantastic for getting some extra FTP building while you are in a fatigued state. Extra emphasis on cadence stresses your nervous system, making your body more efficient at higher and lower RPMs while improving your form. The Neuromuscular training you get from this session is fantastic, so while your power never exceeds threshold, your body will learn to bring more energy to the pedals at all intensities.\n",

We\u2019ll kick off with 5 x 30-second cadence builds, allowing for 2 minutes of recovery between each, before moving on to 5 x 60-second cadence holds, again with 2 minutes recovery.\n\nWhile this session may be short, it\u2019s a key part of your weekly plan, designed to keep you efficient and in top form, even when the cadence ramps up. Stay smooth and steady\u2014and remember, \u201Cno bobbing!\u201D\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Builds:** The name of the game here is absolute peak cadence, not peak power. To achieve this, you need to be in a small gear and have very light resistance. Starting at 90-RPM, steadily increase your cadence until you reach your absolute max with about 5-seconds left, and hold that to the end. Your limiting factor on these efforts needs to be leg speed. If resistance/power output is your limiting factor, try starting in an easier gear, or shift into an easier gear 15-seconds in. Bouncing in the saddle is okay for this drill.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Holds**: These efforts require you to maintain the highest cadence you can without starting to bounce in the saddle. For some of you that will be 100-RPM, for others, it will be 150-RPM. The key is to settle into YOUR peak sustainable cadence. Like the Builds, the goal here is not high power, so these efforts are limited to 90% of FTP. Do not be surprised if your heart rate is well into Zone 4 by the time you hit the last few holds.\n\n\nTo properly execute this session, your effort between drills needs to be low. With limited recovery time between these maximal Neuromuscular Efforts, riding above Zone 1 between efforts will only reduce your ability to max out your cadence. While the power targets between are Zone 1, do not be surprised if your heart rate does not drop below Zone 2 after the first couple builds.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/9885886076)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

              "description": "This session is all about high-torque efforts, very similar to the efforts you would experience riding up the steep slopes of Mt Sufferlandria. While these efforts are short and the intensity isn\u2019t too high, the low cadence targets combined with minimal recovery will leave some begging for the high-cadence sprints of _The Omnium_. High-torque efforts like these have two primary benefits: improved neuromuscular coordination and increased muscular endurance.\n\n\u200B\n\nDuring each pedal revolution, your legs have to \u201Cswitch on\u201D and \u201Cswitch off\u201D almost all of the muscles in your legs. High-cadence efforts in something like _Cadence Builds_ are great for teaching these groups to make that switch quickly. These low-cadence efforts are better for teaching ALL of the muscles in your legs to \u201Cswitch on.\u201D Done properly, you should be pulling with your hamstrings with one leg while the other leg is pushing down with all the force your glutes and quads can muster. If you feel like you are pushing yourself up out of the saddle during harder efforts (like seated sprints), your hamstrings are not being utilized since they should pull you back down into your saddle.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe second main benefit is improved muscular endurance. Even though the session is under 45 minutes, **you\u0027ll put a similar amount of muscular fatigue into your legs as a steady, multi-hour base ride.** You can almost view this session as hitting the leg press for 8 sets of 100 reps. And just like the weight room, proper form is absolutely key. That means:\n\n- You should focus on pushing down AND pulling back up. You want your glutes and quads activated on the way down and your hamstring and hip flexors activated on the way up.\n- To properly engage your hamstrings think about trying to pulling your heel up to your butt when your crank arm is going from 6 o\u2019clock to 10 o\u2019clock.\n- Your knees should be tracking straight up and down, no collapsing in or out.\n- Your core should be fully engaged to keep your hips steady in the saddle. This will be easier if you are both pushing and pulling during each pedal revolution.\n\nThis session is very similar to _Power Station_. Both help improve your muscular endurance and coordination; the biggest difference is the work to rest ratio between the two. While the intervals here are shorter than those in _Power Station_, the decreased recovery duration means fatigue will build faster, especially for those with a weakness in repeated efforts.\n\nModifying interval length and recovery duration can also be seen between sessions like _Revolver_ and _A Very Dark Place_. Both serve up a healthy dose of MAP/VO2 work, but the overall feeling of those two sessions is different.\n\nIf you find that your lower back starts to ache during this session or that you have to start rocking in the saddle to keep the power up, then it\u2019s time for you to get started on the SYSTM Yoga program. Kick it off with \u201CCore Strengtheners \u201D to make sure your core is just as strong as those legs.\n\n\u200B\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to \u0027[When to Train with Low Cadence](https://the-knowledge-by-wahoo-sports-science.simplecast.com/episodes/when-to-train-with-low-cadence)\u0027 on The Knowledge Podcast by Wahoo Sports Science.\n",

Your body can only handle so much time above FTP in any given week (or month, for that matter). But that doesn\u2019t mean you should sit around doing nothing the rest of the time.\n\n\u200B\n\nYour body is most efficient at clearing out lactate and other metabolic byproducts at 80-95% of FTP. This is one of the few sessions where you can consistently sit at that intensity and let your body churn away at this nice, efficient effort level. It\u0027s the ideal workout to end a hard, three-day block or add in during a rest week. It will give your body a little training stimulus while still allowing it to recover from whatever tortures you\u0027ve recently put it through.\n",

The first two drills, Cadence Holds and Builds, are designed to improve the way you recruit your leg, glute and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke. They do this by forcing you to sustain a cadence just above \u0027comfortable\u0027 and by pushing you to your maximal cadence.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe last drill, Single Leg Efforts, ask you to unclip one leg and ride at a steady, single-legged effort. This forces you to pull up on the pedal instead of just pushing down and ensures maximal muscle awareness and engagement. This workout is best done while riding indoors on a trainer because even small variations in terrain can affect your ability to properly execute this workout. The majority of this workout is done in heart rate Z1/2 /// 50-75% of threshold /// RPE 2-5. You should keep the effort level below threshold (heart rate Z4, 100% of threshold, RPE 7-8) during the max cadence efforts.\n\n\u200B\n\nWORKOUT GOALS:\n\n- To improve stillness and stability at high cadences.\n- To improve muscle fiber engagement for improved efficiency at all cadences.\n- To increase maximum cadence.\n- To make that pedal stroke as smooth as butter.\n\nCADENCE TARGETS:\n\n- Warm-up 80-90rpm\n- Build: 90-150rpm\n- Hold: 115rpm\n- Single Leg: 85rpm\n\nListen to The Knowledge podcast, by Wahoo Sports Science - The Benefits of High Cadence Training: [https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence](https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n3 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 3\n\nRest Between Sets: 8 minutes @ RPE 23 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: N/A\n\n**Interval**\n\nCadence Build: 30 seconds @ RPE 8 -- Starting at 90RPM Build to Max RPM -- Max Power is NOT Goal\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nCadence Hold: 45 seconds @ RPE 7.5 -- \u003C100% FTP -- Highest RPM you can hold without Bouncing\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nSingle Leg: 1 minute @ RPE 6 -- Single Leg Only -- \u003C50% of FTP\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nSingle Leg: 1 minute @ RPE 6 -- Single Leg Only, Opposite Leg -- \u003C50% of FTP (100% of FTP with both legs = 50% of FTP\n\nwith one leg)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n8 minutes 15 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

Why? Going above threshold causes a considerable amount of hormonal stress that takes a lot of time to recover from. But you don\u2019t actually have to ride above threshold to improve your FTP. The difference in fitness gains between 30 minutes at 90% of threshold and at 102% of threshold is minimal. Still, the stress on your body from the latter is much greater, and the recovery much longer.\n\n\u200B\n\nThat\u0027s why this session is a key component to any training plan: It gives you enough training stress to help improve your FTP but remains \u0027easy\u0027 enough that you can do it when you\u0027re tired or before a big block of harder efforts.\n",

The first two drills, Cadence Holds and Builds, are designed to improve the way you recruit your leg, glute and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke. They do this by forcing you to sustain a cadence just above \u0027comfortable\u0027 and by pushing you to your maximal cadence.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe last drill, Single Leg Efforts, ask you to unclip one leg and ride at a steady, single-legged effort. This forces you to pull up on the pedal instead of just pushing down and ensures maximal muscle awareness and engagement. This workout is best done while riding indoors on a trainer because even small variations in terrain can affect your ability to properly execute this workout. The majority of this workout is done in heart rate Z1/2 /// 50-75% of threshold /// RPE 2-5. You should keep the effort level below threshold (heart rate Z4, 100% of threshold, RPE 7-8) during the max cadence efforts.\n\n\u200B\n\nWORKOUT GOALS:\n\n- To improve stillness and stability at high cadences.\n- To improve muscle fiber engagement for improved efficiency at all cadences.\n- To increase maximum cadence.\n- To make that pedal stroke as smooth as butter.\n\nCADENCE TARGETS:\n\n- Warm-up 80-90rpm\n- Build: 90-150rpm\n- Hold: 115rpm\n- Single Leg: 85rpm\n\nListen to The Knowledge podcast, by Wahoo Sports Science - The Benefits of High Cadence Training: [https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence](https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n3 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 3\n\nRest Between Sets: 8 minutes @ RPE 23 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: N/A\n\n**Interval**\n\nCadence Build: 30 seconds @ RPE 8 -- Starting at 90RPM Build to Max RPM -- Max Power is NOT Goal\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nCadence Hold: 45 seconds @ RPE 7.5 -- \u003C100% FTP -- Highest RPM you can hold without Bouncing\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nSingle Leg: 1 minute @ RPE 6 -- Single Leg Only -- \u003C50% of FTP\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nSingle Leg: 1 minute @ RPE 6 -- Single Leg Only, Opposite Leg -- \u003C50% of FTP (100% of FTP with both legs = 50% of FTP\n\nwith one leg)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n8 minutes 15 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

              "description": "If you want a do-it-all session that will maintain and improve nearly every aspect of your fitness, _The Chores_ is just the ticket. This workout features 3 sets of intervals. Each set combines a series of 40-second efforts with 20-second recoveries, followed by an immediate transition to a sustained effort just below threshold. These short efforts with minimal recovery deplete your anaerobic gas tank, forcing your body to get better at producing power aerobically. This combination will help improve your Anaerobic Capacity, (AC) your Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP), and your Functional Threshold Power (FTP), all in just under an hour.\n\n\u200B\n\nAt the start of each set, your body starts to dip into your anaerobic reserves to help hit the high-power targets. Your body then starts to ramp up your oxygen intake in order to produce more of the power requirements aerobically. With such short recovery time between these efforts, your AC is steadily drained through each set. By the time the last short interval arrives, your body will be forced to produce almost all of that power aerobically, which will push your lungs to their very limit.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis is the optimal time to stress your body\u2019s ability to produce power at threshold. With your AC depleted (and your lungs and heart working near maximal capacity), the shorter sustained efforts that would normally be a piece of cake will have a bit more...sting. No matter what your preferred discipline, terrain, or distance, this session will make you fitter and faster.\n\n\u200B\n\nFeaturing exciting, on-bike camera footage from the Velon Hammer Series, _The Chores_ will make you earn your keep.\n",

Cadence builds improve how you recruit your leg, gluteal, and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke by progressing to your maximal cadence. By reaching your highest cadence possible, you are training the \u0027on/off\u0027 switch in each muscle group to not only work faster but to have less overlap with your other muscle groups. This session trains your hamstring muscles to \u0027turn off\u0027 when your quads \u0027turn on\u0027 and vice-versa, resulting in a more efficient pedal stroke at both high and low cadences.\n\n\u200B\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to The Knowledge podcast, by Wahoo Sports Science - The Benefits of High Cadence Training: [https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence](https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence)\n",

By giving them a bit of a rest early on they\u0027ll have a better chance of making a move as the race winds towards the iconic finish in the picturesque hill town of Sienna. Your job is to make sure everybody in the break works well together to maintain a gap and hold off the peloton for as long as you can. The other teams\u0027 star riders are breathing down your neck. How long can you keep them at bay?\n\n\u200B\n\n**About ProRides**\n\nHere\u2019s your chance to experience what it\u2019s like to ride in the biggest races in the world, thanks to SYSTM\u2019s 4DP platform. We\u2019ve taken the first-person camera footage and power data from a pro cyclist and analyzed it to determine which part of their 4DP\u00AE profile each of their efforts corresponds to. But since few of us can put down pro-level watts, we made it so all of the efforts are scaled to your own personal 4DP\u00AE profile. That means you get to experience exactly what the pros experience relative to your own abilities. When they sprint, you sprint. When they attack, you attack. When they sit up, you get to take it (relatively) easy. It\u0027s the most immersive, realistic race simulation out there.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s some more information on how to create the most immersive ProRides experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterProRides)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Featured Footage: **Velon\n",

This one, however is a little less focused on Anaerobic Capacity and a little more on muscle endurance, due to that big blue block in the middle. The first pyramid will begin to fatigue your muscles and tax your AC before you face 20 minutes at tempo. With both of those efforts under your belt, the second pyramid will drain the rest of your AC and ask your aerobic system to pick up the slack. This might even feel similar to a mountain bike or cyclocross race effort- you take it out hard, jockeying for the hole shot or a front pack position before getting into the technical elements. Then you settle into a sustainable effort for a short while, maybe working with a couple others before battling it out for your final finishing position.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n9 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4 -- 70% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n**Build x3**\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n1 minute 30 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of sets: 2\n\nRest between sets: 20 minutes @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR \u003C100\n\nInterval repeats per set: 1\n\n**Interval **\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 200% of FTP -- \u003E105%\n\n50 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 9.5 -- 180% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n40 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 150% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n40 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n50 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n50 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n40 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 150% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 9.5 -- 180% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n40 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 200% of FTP -- \u003E105%\n\n7 minutes 30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume **\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down **\n\n10 minutes 40 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n",

The fact that all those surges take place during sustained efforts right around threshold makes this one of the most difficult (yet beneficial) workouts in The Sufferfest Library.

This session is designed to sharpen muscle activation and improve recovery after intense efforts.\n\nFinish strong, and I\u2019ll see you in Burgberg!\n\n\u200B\n\nWith short near-maximal sprint efforts like these, you\u2019ll recruit all of the muscle fibers in your legs. While cadence builds force your muscles to contract and relax as quickly as possible, this session forces your muscles to contract with maximal power. Just like cadence builds, this session becomes one of the best ways to train your neuromuscular system.\n\nEven if your target event does not require you to complete maximal sprints, there is a substantial trickle-down efficiency effect to the longer-duration power efforts when you train your neuromuscular system.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/9866624296)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

              "description": "The 3x25-minute sub-threshold workout is one of the most classic interval sessions out there, so prepare for a trip to the northern Painlands for this FTP-builder. The reason the 3x25 sub-threshold workout is so popular is that it is easy to follow, helps teach good pacing, and gives you a great threshold training stimulus.\n\n\u200B\n\nIn this case, you\u0027re looking at three, (roughly) 25-minute blocks at around 90% of your FTP, an effort we refer to as \u0022Sub-Threshold\u0022. Many refer to this intensity as \u0022Sweet-Spot\u0022, but we prefer Sub-Threshold, as the real key is to never let your power creep above your FTP. Staying just below threshold ensures that your effort remains at an intensity you know your body can handle but that is close to what would not be sustainable.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe only way you\u0027re going to make it through three of these efforts is if you pace yourself properly. Everyone feels just fine for the first 5 minutes of the first effort, and are often tempted to go harder. Don\u0027t be that person. More often than not, that person blows up spectacularly in the second interval, unable to finish the session. Or they have to ride that second interval at lower power, turning it into a Tempo session, which is not the goal.\n\n\u200B\n\nGetting a sense of how these efforts \u0022bite\u0022 towards the end is vital to learning how to pace yourself over longer steady-state efforts; whether that\u0027s a time trial, local climb, breakaway, triathlon, or even a good old fitness test. In each of those cases, the pacing is key. Learning how your perceived effort can steadily climb even though your power remains unchanged is critical to good pacing.\n\n\u200B\n\nSo how do you know if you are doing this one right? As we said, the first 5 minutes should feel relatively easy. Around that 5-minute mark, your heart rate should stop climbing, and settle into 2-5% below your Lactate Threshold Heart Rate (LTHR). If your heart rate is climbing for the entire effort and goes above your LTHR, then you are going too hard.\n\nIf you hit the 10-minute mark, your legs feel fine, and your heart rate is still in Zone 3, then you aren\u0027t going hard enough.\n\nIf you\u0027ve never done a session like this before, you can consider only doing the first 20-minute effort, or even sticking to just the first 15 minutes of each effort. There\u0027s no shame in building up to this full session, so don\u0027t be afraid to pause and fast forward as needed.\n\n\u200B\n\nNailing this session is really about getting in tune with your body and understanding what the edge between a sustainable and an unsustainable effort feels like. Not being able to complete this workout is fairly common, so don\u0027t beat yourself up if you can\u0027t make it through the first few times. As long as you come away from this session with a better understanding of how to pace longer efforts, you\u0027ve improved as an athlete.\n",

              "description": "**Half Monty: The Easy One.**\n\n\u200B\n\nWe recommend this fitness test for:\n\n- Newer riders\n- Athletes with limited experience pacing maximal efforts / fitness testing.\n- Those who are mid-plan or who just want to get a sense of where their fitness is.\n\nThe _Half Monty_ 4DP fitness test is the most accurate and complete ramp test available. While it\u0027s not as comprehensive or as accurate as our main fitness test, _Full Frontal_, it\u0027s far more approachable and easier to pace for new riders. It also doesn\u0027t require any special preparation. You just need to feel relatively fresh.\n\n\u200B\n\nBased on more than a year of research (and after dozens of lab tests and thousands of online tests) and using sophisticated analysis of power and heart rate data, _Half Monty_ is far more accurate and comprehensive than standard ramp tests.\n\n\u200B\n\nIt also tells you more about who you are as an athlete. _Half Monty_ provides you with your FTP, Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP), and Cycling Threshold Heart Rate (cTHR), all of which we use to personalize your workout targets.\n\n\u200B\n\nIf you\u0027re still using the 4DP estimates when you set up your account, _Half Monty_ will also refine your AC and NM estimates (but will not do so if you\u0027ve done _Full Frontal_ or manually adjusted your estimates). If you want fully accurate AC and NM, as well as your Rider Type, Strengths, Weaknesses, and training plans adjusted to those Strengths and Weaknesses, you\u0027ll need to expose yourself to the _Full Frontal_ 4DP fitness test.\n\n\u200B\n\nReady to climb the ramp? You\u0027ll need the following before you start:\n\n- A heart rate monitor if you want the most accurate results. Don\u0027t have one? Order one [HERE](https://wahoofitness.com/devices)\n- Some kind of power device connected (trainer, power meter, virtual power, etc.)\n- Be ready to pay close attention to the instructions in the workout\n- Be sure your profile is complete and up-to-date (Profile \u003E About You). Accurate information helps us make our calculations\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to \u0027[Why Fitness Testing Matters](https://the-knowledge-by-wahoo-sports-science.simplecast.com/episodes/testing-testing-1-2-3-why-fitness-testing-matters)\u0027 on The Knowledge Podcast by Wahoo Sports Science.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s some more information on how to get the most from your fitness test.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterFitnessAssessment)\n",

You would be right. That\u0027s why we would never do something as crazy as letting you start the 2nd set from The Shovel fresh. Instead, you get to be the Nail for the first 3 efforts from Nine Hammers. Once you\u0027ve done that and wrapped up that second set from The Shovel, all that stands between you and that massive pit of exhaustion and GLORY are 2 more Hammers. Did we mention they were Hammers 8 and 9? No? Good, good. Forget we said anything. Just pretend you have 3 Hammers and 1 Shovel to contend with. Those last 2 Hammers are \u0022Future You\u0027s\u0022 problem - let that chump deal with the nightmare.\n\n\u200B\n\nWhen asking, \u0022will this make me faster?\u0022 the answer is YES (and, at least in the short term, quite miserable). _The Shovel_ packs a massive Anaerobic Capacity (AC) punch, with inverse-micro intervals that dish out ever higher the power the shorter the interval. While_ Nine Hammers_ packs a huge MAP/FTP punch, it also helps drive up your sustained power regardless of your rider type or weakness. Facing the first 3 hammers gives your aerobic (MAP/FTP) system a hefty load to deal with and will just about fully deplete your AC stores, which makes this the perfect time to start the 2nd set from _The Shovel_. With depleted reserves, starting with the short 5 second sprints ensures that you are just fresh enough to push your NM system but fatigued enough that your AC never fully recovers for the duration of these intervals. With your AC depleted, heart rate pegged, and breathing rate through the roof, the last thing you WANT is the final 2 hammers. This isn\u0027t about what you want, though. It\u0027s about what you need.\n\n\u200B\n\nBy the time you start this set of hammers, your top-end power will be feeling completely drained; any \u0022snap\u0022 you might usually rely on to make it through these 3-4 minute efforts will be long gone. That means you are facing down the final 2 hammers relying solely on your MAP and FTP. The higher your FTP, the faster you will recover, and the higher your MAP, the greater the punishment you can handle. Once you pick yourself up off the floor from hammers 8 and 9, you will have pushed your body to its absolute limits across almost every 4DP Metric, which will send you down the path to be a faster and more badass Sufferlandrian.\n",

Even for an hour? Well, now\u0027s your chance. _Getting Away With It_ gets you out of the office and onto the roads of the French Pyrenees with your guide Michael Cotty of The Col Collective.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis is a great session to add toward the end of a training block. The shorter duration, sub-threshold efforts are fantastic for getting some extra FTP building while you are in a fatigued state. Extra emphasis on cadence stresses your nervous system, making your body more efficient at higher and lower RPMs while improving your form. The Neuromuscular training you get from this session is fantastic, so while your power never exceeds threshold, your body will learn to bring more energy to the pedals at all intensities.\n",

By reaching your highest cadence possible, you are training the \u0027on/off\u0027 switch in each muscle group to not only work faster but to have less overlap with your other muscle groups.

              "description": "Meandering along the scenic River Iller, it\u2019s time to break out your gravel bike for a classic cadence build and hold session. We\u2019ll kick off with 5 x 30-second cadence builds, allowing for 2 minutes of recovery between each, before moving on to 5 x 60-second cadence holds, again with 2 minutes recovery.\n\nWhile this session may be short, it\u2019s a key part of your weekly plan, designed to keep you efficient and in top form, even when the cadence ramps up. Stay smooth and steady\u2014and remember, \u201Cno bobbing!\u201D\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Builds:** The name of the game here is absolute peak cadence, not peak power. To achieve this, you need to be in a small gear and have very light resistance. Starting at 90-RPM, steadily increase your cadence until you reach your absolute max with about 5-seconds left, and hold that to the end. Your limiting factor on these efforts needs to be leg speed. If resistance/power output is your limiting factor, try starting in an easier gear, or shift into an easier gear 15-seconds in. Bouncing in the saddle is okay for this drill.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Holds**: These efforts require you to maintain the highest cadence you can without starting to bounce in the saddle. For some of you that will be 100-RPM, for others, it will be 150-RPM. The key is to settle into YOUR peak sustainable cadence. Like the Builds, the goal here is not high power, so these efforts are limited to 90% of FTP. Do not be surprised if your heart rate is well into Zone 4 by the time you hit the last few holds.\n\n\nTo properly execute this session, your effort between drills needs to be low. With limited recovery time between these maximal Neuromuscular Efforts, riding above Zone 1 between efforts will only reduce your ability to max out your cadence. While the power targets between are Zone 1, do not be surprised if your heart rate does not drop below Zone 2 after the first couple builds.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/9885886076)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

We\u2019ll be breaking this 10km climb down into three distinct sections, kicking off with a block of 6 x 50 second high tempo efforts with a 10 second burst out of the saddle before taking a swift breather before getting back on it. As we climb through the pine forest we\u2019ll switch things up a touch, alternating between low and high cadence for 30 seconds at a time for around 7 minutes. We\u2019ll then revert back to our 50 second high tempo with 10 second burst out of the saddle efforts before we build up our effort to the summit. This is going to be a challenging workout so make sure you\u2019re ready and whatever you do don\u2019t forget to take a moment to look at the views!!\n\n\u200B\n\nThis workout combines multiple different interval types that focus on improving threshold power via over-under style efforts along with low cadence work for your muscular endurance.

              "description": "You can never have too many tools in the shed. After years of lobbying, we finally convinced Grunter von Agony to share his favorite set of implements with us: the fabled _14 Vise Grips_. Taken individually, each of the 14 intervals might appear tame, incapable of inflicting a significant squeeze. But when expertly applied in the correct order, they apply just the right kind of pressure to turn a Couchlandrian into a Sufferlandrian, just like turning coal into diamonds.\n\n\u200B\n\nWhile the duration of each Vise Grip varies (from 30 seconds to 2 minutes), the power targets and recovery durations between them remain constant. The first 30-second interval should feel like a Sunday stroll in the park, but by the end of the first 2-minute Vise Grip, you\u0027ll be cursing Grunter\u0027s name. As the intervals get shorter, time will appear to stretch. That final 30-second effort will feel like an eternity. When you roll up to the second set, you\u0027ll know what you\u0027re in for, so just put your head down and prepare yourself to crush or be crushed.\n\n\u200B\n\nOnce you make it through all 14 Vise Grips, you will have been north of your Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) for a total of 16 minutes. Changing the duration of the efforts (while keeping the same recovery) stresses your Anaerobic Capacity (AC) in a more dynamic way than, say, a more straightforward on/off session like _Half is Easy_. Since the longer efforts have the same recovery duration as the shorter ones, you will eventually deplete your AC, forcing your body to rely on your MAP to hit the required power targets. As the intervals get shorter in the second half of each set, you\u0027ll find that you have just enough left in the tank to complete the next effort.\n\n\u200B\n\nUltimately this workout combines the advantages of shorter, higher-power intervals with longer recovery (great for building muscular strength) with the advantages of longer, higher-power intervals with inadequate recovery (great for driving up your MAP and improving your AC).\n",

The first two drills, Cadence Holds and Builds, are designed to improve the way you recruit your leg, glute and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke. They do this by forcing you to sustain a cadence just above \u0027comfortable\u0027 and by pushing you to your maximal cadence.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe last drill, Single Leg Efforts, ask you to unclip one leg and ride at a steady, single-legged effort. This forces you to pull up on the pedal instead of just pushing down and ensures maximal muscle awareness and engagement. This workout is best done while riding indoors on a trainer because even small variations in terrain can affect your ability to properly execute this workout. The majority of this workout is done in heart rate Z1/2 /// 50-75% of threshold /// RPE 2-5. You should keep the effort level below threshold (heart rate Z4, 100% of threshold, RPE 7-8) during the max cadence efforts.\n\n\u200B\n\nWORKOUT GOALS:\n\n- To improve stillness and stability at high cadences.\n- To improve muscle fiber engagement for improved efficiency at all cadences.\n- To increase maximum cadence.\n- To make that pedal stroke as smooth as butter.\n\nCADENCE TARGETS:\n\n- Warm-up 80-90rpm\n- Build: 90-150rpm\n- Hold: 115rpm\n- Single Leg: 85rpm\n\nListen to The Knowledge podcast, by Wahoo Sports Science - The Benefits of High Cadence Training: [https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence](https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n3 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 3\n\nRest Between Sets: 8 minutes @ RPE 23 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: N/A\n\n**Interval**\n\nCadence Build: 30 seconds @ RPE 8 -- Starting at 90RPM Build to Max RPM -- Max Power is NOT Goal\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nCadence Hold: 45 seconds @ RPE 7.5 -- \u003C100% FTP -- Highest RPM you can hold without Bouncing\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nSingle Leg: 1 minute @ RPE 6 -- Single Leg Only -- \u003C50% of FTP\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nSingle Leg: 1 minute @ RPE 6 -- Single Leg Only, Opposite Leg -- \u003C50% of FTP (100% of FTP with both legs = 50% of FTP\n\nwith one leg)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n8 minutes 15 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

              "description": "When it comes to \u0022peaking\u0022, or performing at your absolute best on a given day, the key is nailing your Taper. The term \u0022Taper\u0022 refers to how you train in the week or so before your target event to ensure you deliver your best performance. Generally, tapering means reducing your total training volume but continuing to hit some high-intensity efforts. While there are individual variations in the best way to taper, this session has been used by countless professionals leading into the biggest races of their lives -- athletes like World Champions Rohan Dennis and Flora Duffy.\n\n\u200B\n\nWith 3 sets of micro-intervals (40/20s, 30/30s, and 20/40s) you will hit your system with just enough intensity to keep your legs sharp and responsive, without adding any real fatigue. Outside of those 3 sets of micro-intervals, this session is purposefully short and easy. This is a preparation session, not a training session! After all, your event is just around the corner and all of the important training is behind you. Riding harder or longer today will do absolutely nothing to increase your fitness by event day; in fact, all that would do is increase your fatigue, which will only hurt your performance. Rather, this session makes sure your body is humming along and ready to perform on the big day.\n",

After 15 years as a professional triathlete, Heather Jackson decided to challenge herself in new ways, build a fresh community, and push her own and other\u0027s expectations of what is humanly possible. In June, Heather tackled the Unbound Gravel 200, often hailed as the \u0022Super Bowl\u0022 of gravel bike racing, and the iconic Western States Endurance Run, the world\u2019s oldest 100-mile trail race. Facing these demanding events with just a two-week gap between them, the question looms: how will Heather approach her most ambitious goal yet?\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: This is a great way to watch a compelling documentary while developing your baseline aerobic fitness. The intensity of this workout will vary mostly between 60-70% of FTP, with heart rate remaining entirely in zone 2.

With increased range of motion, the routine progresses to gentle, dynamic stretches for the calves, hamstrings, and hips. Since feet are often neglected and subjected to high demands from activities like running or cycling, practicing this sequence at least once a week helps to rebalance and address this issue.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe objectives are to improve mobility in the feet and ankles, stretch the calves and hamstrings, and open up the hips.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Poses in this session:**\n\n- Easy Seat\n- Box Breathing\n- Foot Massage\n- Downward Dog\n- Screaming Toe\n- Yoga Squat\n- Ankle Stretch\n- Ankle Mobilisations\n- Windscreen Wipers\n",
