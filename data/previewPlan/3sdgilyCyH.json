      "description": "#### **Special Focus: Core Level 2**\n\nThis six week training plan is specifically designed to improve your core strength and pelvic stability, which is often neglected in endurance athletes. With three short focused sessions per week this is the perfect way to get in the extra time to concentrate on the three dimensional segment from shoulder to hip. You can add this as an off-season block or an extra bump to your regular season training. These workouts will target core muscles but will also include considerable demand for the smaller muscles of the upper body.\n\n\u200B\n\nLevel 2 is ideal if you have recently completed Level 1 or are returning from a three to six month lay-off. As with any of the SYSTM strength plans, take your time with each session and follow the proper progression to experience results.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis plan may be applied in conjunction with other Special Focused strength plans or with one of the 12 week add-ons for extra core training. However, if you add concurrent strength plans please be mindful that you are getting adequate recovery between workouts.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe Special Focus stand alone plans follow a 2:1 progression and have three sessions per week on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.\n\n\u200B\n\nHere we go!\n",

The result? Improved core strength, stability, and endurance. You\u0027ll find exercises that carry over into other areas of your body, but all of the moves have a significant impact on your core. Level 1 is ideal for very beginners. Even then, you may find some of these moves challenging if you have never attempted them. That\u2019s ok, take your time and pause the video if you need. Soon you\u2019ll be on your way to mastering your core potential.

The Core Focus series builds up everything from your hip to your shoulders - front, back, and side._\n\n\u200B\n\nTo do this, we\u2019ll take you through a variety of contraction types: eccentric (lengthening), concentric (shortening), and isometric (holding a position). The result? Improved core strength, stability, and endurance. You\u0027ll find exercises that carry over into other areas of your body, but all of the moves have a significant impact on your core. Level 1 is ideal for very beginners. Even then, you may find some of these moves challenging if you have never attempted them. That\u2019s ok, take your time and pause the video if you need. Soon you\u2019ll be on your way to mastering your core potential. In addition to a mat, you\u0027ll need some open wall space for this routine.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?
