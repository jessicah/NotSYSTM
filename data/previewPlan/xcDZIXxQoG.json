We\u2019ll be breaking this 10km climb down into three distinct sections, kicking off with a block of 6 x 50 second high tempo efforts with a 10 second burst out of the saddle before taking a swift breather before getting back on it. As we climb through the pine forest we\u2019ll switch things up a touch, alternating between low and high cadence for 30 seconds at a time for around 7 minutes. We\u2019ll then revert back to our 50 second high tempo with 10 second burst out of the saddle efforts before we build up our effort to the summit. This is going to be a challenging workout so make sure you\u2019re ready and whatever you do don\u2019t forget to take a moment to look at the views!!\n\n\u200B\n\nThis workout combines multiple different interval types that focus on improving threshold power via over-under style efforts along with low cadence work for your muscular endurance. The first and last climbs also fire up your whole energy systems with some sprints to the summit.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/8735613403)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty. As founder of The Col Collective, Mike has made a career out of riding, filming, and telling the story of epic rides and mountains across the continent. As your On Location co-creator and host, Mike\u0027s engaging character, curious mind, and friendly nature will have you cueing up your next ride with him before you\u0027ve even finished the cool-down._\n",

Like a real bike race, you\u0027re working hard to stay with the leaders while fending off attacks and doing your best to make the race by attacking as well.\n\n\u200B\n\nWith significant time spent at power well above your threshold, this is a solid session to improve your Anaerobic Capacity. The fact that all those surges take place during sustained efforts right around threshold makes this one of the most difficult (yet beneficial) workouts in The Sufferfest Library. Repeated surges followed by sustained riding near your threshold stress your body\u0027s ability to clear metabolites (like lactate) and your mental ability to \u201Cdeal\u201D with the extreme discomfort all those metabolites cause. You\u0027re going to come out of this one a bit battered but a lot stronger for it.\n",
