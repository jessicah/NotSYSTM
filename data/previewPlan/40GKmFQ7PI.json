Done correctly, each of the 5 riders will all cross the finish line utterly spent. Pacing is vital. A TTT is essentially one long set of Over / Under intervals. When it\u0027s your turn on the front, you will be well over your FTP, and while those pulls usually only last around 30 seconds, you\u0027ll clock almost 20 pulls over the course of 48k.\n\nPhysiologically speaking, a TTT is one of the best combined AC/MAP/FTP sessions out there. Regardless of your chosen discipline, Rider Type, or rider weakness, this effort will push you to your limits, and you\u0027ll be faster for it.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe original inspiration for our ProRides series, Team Scream just has that bit of...how do we say..._Sufferlandrian-ness_...to make it extra special.\n",

For this session, each interval is 8-minutes in length, with 1-minute blocks at 95% of FTP (Under) and 1-minute blocks at 105% of FTP (Over). The real training benefit comes from that time spent just below FTP trying to \u0022Recover.\u0022 Physiologically, you train your body to be more efficient when working just below FTP.\n",

You do a quick sprint to go after them and quickly get their wheel. The stress of the effort catches up with you, and even though the pace settles down to where it was before, you struggle to hold the wheels.\n\n\u200B\n\nWho Dares is a workout that teaches your body to recover from those efforts more effectively so you can keep riding hard. The workout is based on three 9.5-minute, sub-FTP intervals that feature three sprints: one at the start, one in the middle, and one at the end. These sprints flood your body with metabolites like lactate, then the sustained sub-FTP efforts force your body to clear them out while still working hard.\n\n\u200B\n\nTo make the session even more effective, Who Dares also asks your body to do this work at different cadences, stimulating the nervous system and forcing your body to become even more efficient.\n",

Cash Register is an adaptation of that idea and comes in the format of a sprint/settle/surge session consisting of 4 intervals that get a little shorter (but not easier) each round.\n\n\u200B\n\nEach interval kicks off with a sprint effort that targets your Neuromuscular (NM) power. Then you settle into a controlled, below-FTP effort that will accelerate the rate at which you can clear lactate from your muscles. You\u0027ll finish each effort off with a big surge based on your Anaerobic Capacity (AC). In just 30 minutes, you\u0027ll be doing efforts targeting your sprint power, FTP, and AC for an exceptionally well-rounded workout.\n\n\u200B\n\nSupport the Wahooligan Tour by [donating to the Davis Phinney Foundation](https://secure2.convio.net/dpf/site/TR?pg=pfind\u0026fr_id=1391) and their programs to help people living with Parkinsons.\n",

Just like cadence builds, this session becomes one of the best ways to train your neuromuscular system.\n\nEven if your target event does not require you to complete maximal sprints, there is a substantial trickle-down efficiency effect to the longer-duration power efforts when you train your neuromuscular system.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/9866624296)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

              "description": "Join Mike Cotty and EF-Oatly-Cannondale rider Noemi R\u00FCegg for a reconnaissance ride and sustained effort workout up the iconic Alpe d\u0027Huez. This session begins with a steady warm-up around Bourg d\u0027Oisans before navigating the famous 21 hairpin bends of this epic climb. As the gradient intensifies, settle into a sustainable threshold pace, simulating race conditions and allowing for occasional standing efforts on steeper sections. Throughout the climb, integrate strategic surges to mimic attack responses and maintain high power outputs. The goal is to balance endurance and power, capturing the essence of this legendary ascent while refining your climbing technique and stamina under the guidance of elite athletes.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/11727807011)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Hosts:_\n\n_Noemi came to bike racing through her family, when she was 13, she finished her first cyclocross race and was hooked. She turned professional on the road as a 19-year-old, leaving her full-time job caring for disabled people in a home. She is the 2024 Swiss national champion but her heart belongs to the classics. Noemi loves a punchy course, the more chaotic, the better. She is not afraid to be aggressive in the peloton and loves the excitement and energy of a hectic race._\n\n\u200B\n\n_There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty. As founder of The Col Collective, Mike has made a career out of riding, filming, and telling the story of epic rides and mountains across the continent. As your On Location co-creator and host, Mike\u0027s engaging character, curious mind, and friendly nature will have you cueing up your next ride with him before you\u0027ve even finished the cool-down._\n",
