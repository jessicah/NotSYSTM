              "description": "This session is all about Max Aerobic Power (MAP), also known as VO2 max training. MAP refers to the maximum rate of oxygen delivery and uptake by your body and is an important metric in the world of endurance sports. During this 30-minute session, you\u2019ll be doing five MAP targeted intervals. The first is 3 minutes long, and each successive interval gets 30 seconds shorter until you end with a final effort of \u201Cjust\u201D 60 seconds. The structure of each interval varies to keep you on your toes, some with increases in power, some with decreases.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe cadence targets for this session are generally going to be a little higher than \u201Ccomfortable\u201D for most people \u2013 and for a very specific reason. We want to maximize the cardiovascular stress of this session rather than loading up your muscular system. But don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll still feel it in your muscles \u2013 likely all of them.\n\n\u200B\n\nTo keep the total stress of this shorter session fairly high, you\u2019re going to have _just enough_ recovery between each effort, but nothing extra \u2013 so don\u2019t let the short duration fool you into thinking this is going to be easy. On the contrary, you might find this to be one of the more challenging\u2014and productive\u2014sessions in our library. Now, go out there and get that stage win!\n",

This is one of the best ways to improve your FTP without really overloading your system with too much training stress.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe final two intervals allow you to really charge over your threshold to unleash whatever power you have left in your legs. These two all-out bursts of power, in addition to the constant surges above threshold, means this session works your Anaerobic Capacity more than some of the other FTP-focused sessions.\n",

The result? Improved core strength, stability, and endurance. You\u0027ll find exercises that carry over into other areas of your body, but all of the moves have a significant impact on your core. Level 1 is ideal for very beginners. Even then, you may find some of these moves challenging if you have never attempted them. That\u2019s ok, take your time and pause the video if you need. Soon you\u2019ll be on your way to mastering your core potential.

There is a reason this simple session has stuck around: it works.\n\n\u200B\n\n30 seconds into a high-intensity effort, enough of your anaerobic energy sources have been depleted that your body shifts to producing that power aerobically. Follow that effort with only 60 seconds of recovery, and your body hasn\u2019t fully replenished those anaerobic stores, meaning it will have to produce that power aerobically after just 25 seconds.\n\n\u200B\n\nWith a total of just 15 (cough, cough) efforts, you will have not only forced your body to replenish its Anaerobic Capacity (AC) over and over, but you\u0027ve just spent several minutes producing lots of power with lots of oxygen. That combination ensures this session hits both your Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) and AC with just the right stress they need to start increasing.\n\n\u200B\n\n_Revolver has recently been remastered (Aug \u002722) to include all new footage and music.

Cadence builds improve how you recruit your leg, gluteal, and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke by progressing to your maximal cadence. By reaching your highest cadence possible, you are training the \u0027on/off\u0027 switch in each muscle group to not only work faster but to have less overlap with your other muscle groups. This session trains your hamstring muscles to \u0027turn off\u0027 when your quads \u0027turn on\u0027 and vice-versa, resulting in a more efficient pedal stroke at both high and low cadences.\n\n\u200B\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to The Knowledge podcast, by Wahoo Sports Science - The Benefits of High Cadence Training: [https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence](https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence)\n",

This journey, in many ways, parallels the experiences of numerous individuals. Why do we need this kind of riding? Why do we crave this adventure? Rather than providing a generic answer, the film delves into Manu\u2019s relationship with cycling as a tool for freedom, exploration, meditation, and perhaps even therapy in some ways. The film unfolds in the Kirghiz mountains during the Silk Road Mountain Race in 2023, where Manu crashed and had to scratch. It then retraces its steps back in time and travels to other lands. Initially, the film was intended to be a video race recap, but it evolved into a love letter to freedom and movement. Eventually, it underwent another transformation, and Scratches is the result of a constantly evolving process in that regard.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: This is a great way to watch a compelling documentary while developing your baseline aerobic fitness.
