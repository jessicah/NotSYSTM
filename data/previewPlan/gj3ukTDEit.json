              "description": "The simple idea of going hard for one minute and then easy for one minute, and then repeating, has been around since whatever evil genius realized that intervals were the best way to train. There is a reason this simple session has stuck around: it works.\n\n\u200B\n\n30 seconds into a high-intensity effort, enough of your anaerobic energy sources have been depleted that your body shifts to producing that power aerobically. Follow that effort with only 60 seconds of recovery, and your body hasn\u2019t fully replenished those anaerobic stores, meaning it will have to produce that power aerobically after just 25 seconds.\n\n\u200B\n\nWith a total of just 15 (cough, cough) efforts, you will have not only forced your body to replenish its Anaerobic Capacity (AC) over and over, but you\u0027ve just spent several minutes producing lots of power with lots of oxygen. That combination ensures this session hits both your Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) and AC with just the right stress they need to start increasing.\n\n\u200B\n\n_Revolver has recently been remastered (Aug \u002722) to include all new footage and music. The workout has a longer warm-up than previous editions._\n",

While not an out-and-out sprinter, you\u2019re the fast man of the AG2R Citroen team. You don\u2019t have a leadout so you\u2019re on your own to grab a result. Do you have what it takes to go it alone and secure the win?\n\n\u200B\n\n**About ProRides**\n\nHere\u2019s your chance to experience what it\u2019s like to ride in the biggest races in the world, thanks to SYSTM\u2019s 4DP platform. We\u2019ve taken the first-person camera footage and power data from a pro cyclist and analyzed it to determine which part of their 4DP\u00AE profile each of their efforts corresponds to. But since few of us can put down pro-level watts, we made it so all of the efforts are scaled to your own personal 4DP\u00AE profile. That means you get to experience exactly what the pros experience relative to your own abilities. When they sprint, you sprint. When they attack, you attack. When they sit up, you get to take it (relatively) easy. It\u0027s the most immersive, realistic race simulation out there.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s some more information on how to create the most immersive ProRides experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterProRides)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Featured Footage: **Velon\n",
