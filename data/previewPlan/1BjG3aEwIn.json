So, while some might call it a trowel\u2026we call it a high-quality micro-interval session, and while Attackers will tend to love it, those who are strong in sustained efforts may find this session a bit more...challenging.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe action-packed 30 minutes includes 17 big efforts varying from 10, 20, and 30 seconds with less than a minute of recovery between each. Together, this will hit your Anaerobic Capacity (AC) and Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) hard, all while helping boost your FTP since the recovery periods are so short. It\u0027s the perfect session to help you break up a block of steady FTP training or to prepare for a criterium, track race, draft legal triathlon, or cyclocross race. Because the targets are all well above FTP, it\u2019s best to come into this session relatively well-rested and motivated.\n",

This session is similar to The Trick, with a few differences. On the plus side, all of the efforts are 15-seconds shorter than those in The Trick. To make up for this, we added two more intervals to this session, bringing the total to 6. That means by the end of this session you will have plowed through 4.5-minutes of AC work.\n\nThis workout is one of the few sessions that we do NOT recommend you complete in ERG mode if you are on a smart trainer. The goal is to hold onto the highest power you can for the full 45-seconds. Inevitably in the later sets, your power will dip before you reach the end of the interval. What we want is for you to complete every effort having given everything for 45-seconds. We don\u0027t want ERG mode grinding you to a halt because you cannot maintain the (ridiculously) high power targets. Even if you drop down below FTP in the final 10-seconds of these efforts, as long as you are going flat out, you are doing it correctly.\n\nJust take this session one interval at a time, and focus on giving your all for this one effort. You can worry about the others when you get to them. If you finish this session without swearing, then you didn\u0027t go hard enough!\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n1 minute 30 seconds @ RPE -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n\n1 minute 15 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 4 -- 70% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n\n45 seconds @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C90\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n\n15 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105\n\n45 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n\n15 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 200% of FTP -- HR \u003E105\n\n1 minute 30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 6\n\nRest Between Sets: 5 minutes 15 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: N/A\n\n**Interval**\n\nEffort: 45 seconds @ RPE 9.5 -- 150% of FTP -- HR \u003E105\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n4 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n",

Level 1 is ideal for very beginners. Even then, you may find some of these moves challenging if you have never attempted them. That\u2019s ok, take your time and pause the video if you need.

This session is similar to The Trick, with a few differences. On the plus side, all of the efforts are 15-seconds shorter than those in The Trick. To make up for this, we added two more intervals to this session, bringing the total to 6. That means by the end of this session you will have plowed through 4.5-minutes of AC work.\n\nThis workout is one of the few sessions that we do NOT recommend you complete in ERG mode if you are on a smart trainer. The goal is to hold onto the highest power you can for the full 45-seconds. Inevitably in the later sets, your power will dip before you reach the end of the interval. What we want is for you to complete every effort having given everything for 45-seconds. We don\u0027t want ERG mode grinding you to a halt because you cannot maintain the (ridiculously) high power targets. Even if you drop down below FTP in the final 10-seconds of these efforts, as long as you are going flat out, you are doing it correctly.\n\nJust take this session one interval at a time, and focus on giving your all for this one effort. You can worry about the others when you get to them.

The first set of sprints has enough recovery that you\u0027ll be able to work your NM to the max. The second set still has enough recovery to allow you to hit high power numbers, but the reduced time between sprints stresses your ability to recover and repeat that high effort. That means you\u0027ll start to dip into AC. The last set\u2014with equal sprint and recovery times\u2014ensures your heart rate never gets a chance to drop down.

              "description": "Meandering along the scenic River Iller, it\u2019s time to break out your gravel bike for a classic cadence build and hold session. We\u2019ll kick off with 5 x 30-second cadence builds, allowing for 2 minutes of recovery between each, before moving on to 5 x 60-second cadence holds, again with 2 minutes recovery.\n\nWhile this session may be short, it\u2019s a key part of your weekly plan, designed to keep you efficient and in top form, even when the cadence ramps up. Stay smooth and steady\u2014and remember, \u201Cno bobbing!\u201D\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Builds:** The name of the game here is absolute peak cadence, not peak power. To achieve this, you need to be in a small gear and have very light resistance. Starting at 90-RPM, steadily increase your cadence until you reach your absolute max with about 5-seconds left, and hold that to the end. Your limiting factor on these efforts needs to be leg speed. If resistance/power output is your limiting factor, try starting in an easier gear, or shift into an easier gear 15-seconds in. Bouncing in the saddle is okay for this drill.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Holds**: These efforts require you to maintain the highest cadence you can without starting to bounce in the saddle. For some of you that will be 100-RPM, for others, it will be 150-RPM. The key is to settle into YOUR peak sustainable cadence. Like the Builds, the goal here is not high power, so these efforts are limited to 90% of FTP. Do not be surprised if your heart rate is well into Zone 4 by the time you hit the last few holds.\n\n\nTo properly execute this session, your effort between drills needs to be low. With limited recovery time between these maximal Neuromuscular Efforts, riding above Zone 1 between efforts will only reduce your ability to max out your cadence. While the power targets between are Zone 1, do not be surprised if your heart rate does not drop below Zone 2 after the first couple builds.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/9885886076)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

Even for an hour? Well, now\u0027s your chance. _Getting Away With It_ gets you out of the office and onto the roads of the French Pyrenees with your guide Michael Cotty of The Col Collective.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis is a great session to add toward the end of a training block. The shorter duration, sub-threshold efforts are fantastic for getting some extra FTP building while you are in a fatigued state. Extra emphasis on cadence stresses your nervous system, making your body more efficient at higher and lower RPMs while improving your form. The Neuromuscular training you get from this session is fantastic, so while your power never exceeds threshold, your body will learn to bring more energy to the pedals at all intensities.\n",
