A recovery spin is a very low intensity ride, so easy that you\u2019d feel embarrassed to ride so slowly if you didn\u2019t know you were helping your body get so much faster.\n\n\u200B\n\nA good recovery spin is done at a cadence above 90 RPM. While keeping power below 50% of FTP, or an RPE less than 2.5, and keeping your heart rate in Zone 1 the entire time. Recovery spins can be done outdoors, but due to the low power demands, they are often easier done on the trainer. Resist the voice of your inner Sufferlandrian telling you to go faster.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Set**\n\n30 minute @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR \u003C70%\n",

The first two drills, Cadence Holds and Builds, are designed to improve the way you recruit your leg, glute and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke. They do this by forcing you to sustain a cadence just above \u0027comfortable\u0027 and by pushing you to your maximal cadence.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe last drill, Single Leg Efforts, ask you to unclip one leg and ride at a steady, single-legged effort. This forces you to pull up on the pedal instead of just pushing down and ensures maximal muscle awareness and engagement. This workout is best done while riding indoors on a trainer because even small variations in terrain can affect your ability to properly execute this workout. The majority of this workout is done in heart rate Z1/2 /// 50-75% of threshold /// RPE 2-5. You should keep the effort level below threshold (heart rate Z4, 100% of threshold, RPE 7-8) during the max cadence efforts.\n\n\u200B\n\nWORKOUT GOALS:\n\n- To improve stillness and stability at high cadences.\n- To improve muscle fiber engagement for improved efficiency at all cadences.\n- To increase maximum cadence.\n- To make that pedal stroke as smooth as butter.\n\nCADENCE TARGETS:\n\n- Warm-up 80-90rpm\n- Build: 90-150rpm\n- Hold: 115rpm\n- Single Leg: 85rpm\n\nListen to The Knowledge podcast, by Wahoo Sports Science - The Benefits of High Cadence Training: [https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence](https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n3 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 3\n\nRest Between Sets: 8 minutes @ RPE 23 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: N/A\n\n**Interval**\n\nCadence Build: 30 seconds @ RPE 8 -- Starting at 90RPM Build to Max RPM -- Max Power is NOT Goal\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nCadence Hold: 45 seconds @ RPE 7.5 -- \u003C100% FTP -- Highest RPM you can hold without Bouncing\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nSingle Leg: 1 minute @ RPE 6 -- Single Leg Only -- \u003C50% of FTP\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nSingle Leg: 1 minute @ RPE 6 -- Single Leg Only, Opposite Leg -- \u003C50% of FTP (100% of FTP with both legs = 50% of FTP\n\nwith one leg)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n8 minutes 15 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

              "description": "If you want a do-it-all session that will maintain and improve nearly every aspect of your fitness, _The Chores_ is just the ticket. This workout features 3 sets of intervals. Each set combines a series of 40-second efforts with 20-second recoveries, followed by an immediate transition to a sustained effort just below threshold. These short efforts with minimal recovery deplete your anaerobic gas tank, forcing your body to get better at producing power aerobically. This combination will help improve your Anaerobic Capacity, (AC) your Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP), and your Functional Threshold Power (FTP), all in just under an hour.\n\n\u200B\n\nAt the start of each set, your body starts to dip into your anaerobic reserves to help hit the high-power targets. Your body then starts to ramp up your oxygen intake in order to produce more of the power requirements aerobically. With such short recovery time between these efforts, your AC is steadily drained through each set. By the time the last short interval arrives, your body will be forced to produce almost all of that power aerobically, which will push your lungs to their very limit.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis is the optimal time to stress your body\u2019s ability to produce power at threshold. With your AC depleted (and your lungs and heart working near maximal capacity), the shorter sustained efforts that would normally be a piece of cake will have a bit more...sting. No matter what your preferred discipline, terrain, or distance, this session will make you fitter and faster.\n\n\u200B\n\nFeaturing exciting, on-bike camera footage from the Velon Hammer Series, _The Chores_ will make you earn your keep.\n",

The bonus is that you also beef up your ability to produce high-end power, building Anaerobic Capacity and Maximal Aerobic Power simultaneously.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe threshold efforts at the end are the bitter cherry on the sundae, improving your body\u0027s ability to produce aerobic power and helping make sure your FTP will get the same boost as your AC and MAP. A rising tide of lactic acid raises all boats. Oh, and clocking in at one hour and 40 minutes, Blender will also help whip your endurance into a frenzy.\n",

While keeping power below 50% of FTP, or an RPE less than 2.5, and keeping your heart rate in Zone 1 the entire time. Recovery spins can be done outdoors, but due to the low power demands, they are often easier done on the trainer.

              "description": "While you\u0027re certainly going to feel this workout in your legs, it\u0027s what happens in your head over these six intervals that matter most. A sort of \u0027Applied Mental Training Program\u0027 session is a unique addition to the SUF library.\n\n\u200B\n\nOver the course of the workout, you\u0027ll be taken through six different mental toughness tasks drawn from the SYSTM Mental Training Program (available here in the app). We\u0027ll teach you how to focus, use positive self-talk, and see an image of Future You to help you push through the Suffering.\n\n\u200B\n\nFrom a physical point of view, this is a series of five-minute intervals with very high Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) efforts at both ends. They pack the same training punch as much longer Sub-Threshold efforts with the added bonus of stimulating your MAP and Anaerobic Capacity (AC) simultaneously.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Physiologically**: The first 30-second effort digs you into an anaerobic hole. Even though it is a MAP-based target, your heart rate and breathing rates (and thus ability to deliver oxygen) are still low, so your body must produce much of this power anaerobically. By the time you settle into the 4-minutes at just below FTP, your body will have produced an excess of metabolites responsible for that burning in your legs. Only by riding below FTP will your body clear them out since FTP is the tipping point where your body produces metabolites at the same rate it is clearing them. By holding you at FTP, your body cannot clear out that excess, forcing you to deal with the associated discomfort for the next 4-minutes.\n\nCapping the effort off with a final 30-second surge requires that you dig into what is left of your AC while your body pushes you close to your VO2 max, or the point at which your body is using as much oxygen as it possibly can. The net result is a session that is great for improving FTP, MAP, and AC, regardless of your strengths and weaknesses.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Psychologically**: Each 4-minute segment at just below FTP will end up feeling harder than it should, given your body is forced to stew in whatever excess metabolites you produced in the first 30-seconds. While it will be unpleasant, you should find it never really gets MORE unpleasant. In addition to the benefits from the actual mental training exercises, this preps you to have confidence in your ability to hold longer sustained FTP efforts. The final surge then shows you that even when you feel uncomfortable for that long, your body still has something more to give. Going through the Mental Training techniques while you\u0027re pushing through the discomfort will only make you stronger out on the road.\n\n\u200B\n\nIn some cultures, the bat symbolizes the death of old ways and the rise of new ones. Time to burn those old, bad habits and build some new, positive ones.\n",

Professional triathlete Eric Lagerstrom sets out on a summer of self-discovery across Colorado, Arizona, and British Columbia, reconnecting with the curiosity that first pulled him into the sport.\n\nAlong the way, he rides remote gravel roads with endurance legend Heather Jackson, dives into icy open water with Olympic gold medalist Simon Whitfield, and runs high alpine ridgelines far from any race course. Together, they explore a deeper purpose in sport\u2014one rooted in wonder, not competition.\n\nShot across three breathtaking locations, this is triathlon like you\u2019ve never seen it: wild, creative, and free.\n\nThis is multi-sport without rules. Movement without limits. Adventure without a stopwatch.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: the workout accompanying this film varies from endurance to tempo to sub-threshold. The higher intensity efforts aren\u0027t the hardest you\u0027ll experience so that you can keep your attention on the film, however, they are just hard enough to help improve your FTP, oxygen utilization efficiency, and the ability to recover quickly between hard efforts. The workout intensity reflects the intensity of the riders in many places, so you may feel as if you\u0027re climbing Mont Ventoux or that you\u0027re a part of Cav\u0027s lead-out train on the run into the finish line.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s how to turn off on-screen graphics for the best viewing experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterInspiration)\n",

              "description": "Meandering along the scenic River Iller, it\u2019s time to break out your gravel bike for a classic cadence build and hold session. We\u2019ll kick off with 5 x 30-second cadence builds, allowing for 2 minutes of recovery between each, before moving on to 5 x 60-second cadence holds, again with 2 minutes recovery.\n\nWhile this session may be short, it\u2019s a key part of your weekly plan, designed to keep you efficient and in top form, even when the cadence ramps up. Stay smooth and steady\u2014and remember, \u201Cno bobbing!\u201D\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Builds:** The name of the game here is absolute peak cadence, not peak power. To achieve this, you need to be in a small gear and have very light resistance. Starting at 90-RPM, steadily increase your cadence until you reach your absolute max with about 5-seconds left, and hold that to the end. Your limiting factor on these efforts needs to be leg speed. If resistance/power output is your limiting factor, try starting in an easier gear, or shift into an easier gear 15-seconds in. Bouncing in the saddle is okay for this drill.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Holds**: These efforts require you to maintain the highest cadence you can without starting to bounce in the saddle. For some of you that will be 100-RPM, for others, it will be 150-RPM. The key is to settle into YOUR peak sustainable cadence. Like the Builds, the goal here is not high power, so these efforts are limited to 90% of FTP. Do not be surprised if your heart rate is well into Zone 4 by the time you hit the last few holds.\n\n\nTo properly execute this session, your effort between drills needs to be low. With limited recovery time between these maximal Neuromuscular Efforts, riding above Zone 1 between efforts will only reduce your ability to max out your cadence. While the power targets between are Zone 1, do not be surprised if your heart rate does not drop below Zone 2 after the first couple builds.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/9885886076)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty. As founder of The Col Collective, Mike has made a career out of riding, filming, and telling the story of epic rides and mountains across the continent. As your On Location co-creator and host, Mike\u0027s engaging character, curious mind, and friendly nature will have you cueing up your next ride with him before you\u0027ve even finished the cool-down._\n",

The shorter duration, sub-threshold efforts are fantastic for getting some extra FTP building while you are in a fatigued state. Extra emphasis on cadence stresses your nervous system, making your body more efficient at higher and lower RPMs while improving your form. The Neuromuscular training you get from this session is fantastic, so while your power never exceeds threshold, your body will learn to bring more energy to the pedals at all intensities.\n",

After a big year of success in Season 3 at the Leadville Trail 100, Season 4 sees a new group of riders reaching for gravel bikes as the race of focus becomes SBT GRVL in Steamboat Springs, CO. In the first of five episodes, the riders meet in Memphis, TN at Victory Bicycle Studio, a local business that is helping the riders find the best bike for them to find success! Follow along and get ready to binge the entire season right now!\n\n\u200B\n\n**Episode 2: Age Is Just A Number**\n\nIn episode 2 we arrive in Bentonville for arguably the MOST important stop on our journey to SBT GRVL, skills. After receiving their bikes in Memphis, TN - Victory Bicycle Studio got them all ready and shipped them to Arkansas to be reunited. In this episode we hear from Rich about why he chose to take on something as daunting as FTGU as well as learn valuable skills with The Ride Series team and 15 of our closest FTGU friends.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Episode 3: Redefining Limits**\n\nIn episode 3 we see our team begin to understand what it will take to finish SBT GRVL. We visit Gunnison, CO for a riding camp to push the limits 6 weeks out from race day. Our goal is to ride the distance and ascent of the race over two days at altitude and see what people struggle with. We also check in with Lou and his path to FTGU. Lou has big goals and finding balance in life and sport is key!\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: This is a great way to watch a compelling documentary while developing your baseline aerobic fitness. The intensity of this workout will vary mostly between 60-70% of FTP, with heart rate remaining entirely in zone 2. This session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s how to turn off on-screen graphics for the best viewing experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterInspiration)\n",

The blend between mind and body, working together to overcome hard moments\u2014be it physical, mental or emotional\u2014and how we learn to cope in our own mind is essential in being able to process the past, be true to ourselves in the present, and create moments of inner peace in the future.\n\n\u200B\n\nA decade after crossing the French Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es non-stop on a ride that would act as a catalyst for change, I wanted to share this story for the first time. To give an insight into the deeper meaning behind some of the mountain challenges you may have seen me undertake over the years, I felt now was the time to head back to my mountains, return to source, and embrace the unknown.\n\n\u200B\n\nOvercoming the mountains of our mind, from escapism to reconnection. 10 years, 10 cols and 10,000 meters of climbing. This is my story of going Full Circle.\n\n\u200B\n\nThank you for watching. I truly hope there is something in this video that can help you in your own journey.\n\n\u200B\n\nPeace,\n\nMike Cotty\u0022\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: The workout accompanying this film is a recovery session, which is a very low-intensity ride. It\u0027s so easy that your power remains at or below 50% of FTP or an RPE less than 2.5, and your heart rate stays in zone 1 the entire time. The intensity and cadence targets will vary throughout this session to keep it interesting (But not so interesting that you can\u0027t pay attention to the film).\n",

We\u2019ll then revert back to our 50 second high tempo with 10 second burst out of the saddle efforts before we build up our effort to the summit.

              "description": "The goal of this workout is to help develop your baseline aerobic fitness. While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are just times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right!\n\n\u200B\n\nMost people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022 Truth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted. So what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like?\n\nFor 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70% is ok, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm and your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster. You will have to trust us on that one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions! Or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\nWarm-Up\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\nMain Effort\n\nNumber of Sets\n\n8.5\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set\n\n1\n\nInterval: 10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n\u200B\n\nExtra Volume\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\nCool Down\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

              "description": "The 3x25-minute sub-threshold workout is one of the most classic interval sessions out there, so prepare for a trip to the northern Painlands for this FTP-builder. The reason the 3x25 sub-threshold workout is so popular is that it is easy to follow, helps teach good pacing, and gives you a great threshold training stimulus.\n\n\u200B\n\nIn this case, you\u0027re looking at three, (roughly) 25-minute blocks at around 90% of your FTP, an effort we refer to as \u0022Sub-Threshold\u0022. Many refer to this intensity as \u0022Sweet-Spot\u0022, but we prefer Sub-Threshold, as the real key is to never let your power creep above your FTP. Staying just below threshold ensures that your effort remains at an intensity you know your body can handle but that is close to what would not be sustainable.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe only way you\u0027re going to make it through three of these efforts is if you pace yourself properly. Everyone feels just fine for the first 5 minutes of the first effort, and are often tempted to go harder. Don\u0027t be that person. More often than not, that person blows up spectacularly in the second interval, unable to finish the session. Or they have to ride that second interval at lower power, turning it into a Tempo session, which is not the goal.\n\n\u200B\n\nGetting a sense of how these efforts \u0022bite\u0022 towards the end is vital to learning how to pace yourself over longer steady-state efforts; whether that\u0027s a time trial, local climb, breakaway, triathlon, or even a good old fitness test. In each of those cases, the pacing is key. Learning how your perceived effort can steadily climb even though your power remains unchanged is critical to good pacing.\n\n\u200B\n\nSo how do you know if you are doing this one right? As we said, the first 5 minutes should feel relatively easy. Around that 5-minute mark, your heart rate should stop climbing, and settle into 2-5% below your Lactate Threshold Heart Rate (LTHR). If your heart rate is climbing for the entire effort and goes above your LTHR, then you are going too hard.\n\nIf you hit the 10-minute mark, your legs feel fine, and your heart rate is still in Zone 3, then you aren\u0027t going hard enough.\n\nIf you\u0027ve never done a session like this before, you can consider only doing the first 20-minute effort, or even sticking to just the first 15 minutes of each effort. There\u0027s no shame in building up to this full session, so don\u0027t be afraid to pause and fast forward as needed.\n\n\u200B\n\nNailing this session is really about getting in tune with your body and understanding what the edge between a sustainable and an unsustainable effort feels like. Not being able to complete this workout is fairly common, so don\u0027t beat yourself up if you can\u0027t make it through the first few times. As long as you come away from this session with a better understanding of how to pace longer efforts, you\u0027ve improved as an athlete.\n",

The first two drills, Cadence Holds and Builds, are designed to improve the way you recruit your leg, glute and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke. They do this by forcing you to sustain a cadence just above \u0027comfortable\u0027 and by pushing you to your maximal cadence.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe last drill, Single Leg Efforts, ask you to unclip one leg and ride at a steady, single-legged effort. This forces you to pull up on the pedal instead of just pushing down and ensures maximal muscle awareness and engagement. This workout is best done while riding indoors on a trainer because even small variations in terrain can affect your ability to properly execute this workout.

While it\u0027s not as comprehensive or as accurate as our main fitness test, _Full Frontal_, it\u0027s far more approachable and easier to pace for new riders. It also doesn\u0027t require any special preparation. You just need to feel relatively fresh.\n\n\u200B\n\nBased on more than a year of research (and after dozens of lab tests and thousands of online tests) and using sophisticated analysis of power and heart rate data, _Half Monty_ is far more accurate and comprehensive than standard ramp tests.\n\n\u200B\n\nIt also tells you more about who you are as an athlete. _Half Monty_ provides you with your FTP, Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP), and Cycling Threshold Heart Rate (cTHR), all of which we use to personalize your workout targets.\n\n\u200B\n\nIf you\u0027re still using the 4DP estimates when you set up your account, _Half Monty_ will also refine your AC and NM estimates (but will not do so if you\u0027ve done _Full Frontal_ or manually adjusted your estimates). If you want fully accurate AC and NM, as well as your Rider Type, Strengths, Weaknesses, and training plans adjusted to those Strengths and Weaknesses, you\u0027ll need to expose yourself to the _Full Frontal_ 4DP fitness test.\n\n\u200B\n\nReady to climb the ramp? You\u0027ll need the following before you start:\n\n- A heart rate monitor if you want the most accurate results. Don\u0027t have one? Order one [HERE](https://wahoofitness.com/devices)\n- Some kind of power device connected (trainer, power meter, virtual power, etc.)\n- Be ready to pay close attention to the instructions in the workout\n- Be sure your profile is complete and up-to-date (Profile \u003E About You). Accurate information helps us make our calculations\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to \u0027[Why Fitness Testing Matters](https://the-knowledge-by-wahoo-sports-science.simplecast.com/episodes/testing-testing-1-2-3-why-fitness-testing-matters)\u0027 on The Knowledge Podcast by Wahoo Sports Science.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s some more information on how to get the most from your fitness test.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterFitnessAssessment)\n",

              "description": "The goal of this workout is to help develop your baseline aerobic fitness. While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high and your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week. Shorter Endurance rides (like this one) can fit in both a hard week of training and a recovery week. That is, only if you do it right! Most people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022\n\n\u200B\n\nTruth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride, especially one under 90 minutes should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted.\n\nSo what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like? For 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70%, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in low to mid Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can; for most this is 80-90rpm. Also, your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster, but you will have to trust us on this one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions, or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: 4\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nNA\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

It explores extraordinary personal stories of ordinary cyclists taking on iconic endurance event Chase The Sun, revealing the power of the humble bicycle to transform lives and help save the planet.\n\nThe film features contributions from broadcaster and ITV\u2019s voice of the Tour de France Ned Boulting, author and blogger Jools Walker, Turner Prize-winning artist Sir Richard Long and 4x Mountain Bike World Champion Tracy Moseley.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: the workout accompanying this film varies from endurance to tempo to sub-threshold.

You\u2019ll also learn to manage your pacing and put out power above your threshold after holding steady just below that breakpoint.\n\n\u200B\n\nRiders with sustained weakness will benefit greatly from this workout, as will anyone looking to push up their FTP.\n\n_Attacker_ is quite similar to the SUF workout, _Defender._ However, the efforts within each interval are 2-minutes shorter, and instead of starting harder and backing off like in _Defender,_ the efforts in this session start controlled and keep squeezing harder and harder until the end.\n",

We\u2019ve taken the first-person camera footage and power data from a pro cyclist and analyzed it to determine which part of their 4DP\u00AE profile each of their efforts corresponds to. But since few of us can put down pro-level watts, we made it so all of the efforts are scaled to your own personal 4DP\u00AE profile. That means you get to experience exactly what the pros experience relative to your own abilities. When they sprint, you sprint. When they attack, you attack. When they sit up, you get to take it (relatively) easy.

              "description": "If you want a do-it-all session that will maintain and improve nearly every aspect of your fitness, _The Chores_ is just the ticket. This workout features 3 sets of intervals. Each set combines a series of 40-second efforts with 20-second recoveries, followed by an immediate transition to a sustained effort just below threshold. These short efforts with minimal recovery deplete your anaerobic gas tank, forcing your body to get better at producing power aerobically. This combination will help improve your Anaerobic Capacity, (AC) your Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP), and your Functional Threshold Power (FTP), all in just under an hour.\n\n\u200B\n\nAt the start of each set, your body starts to dip into your anaerobic reserves to help hit the high-power targets. Your body then starts to ramp up your oxygen intake in order to produce more of the power requirements aerobically. With such short recovery time between these efforts, your AC is steadily drained through each set. By the time the last short interval arrives, your body will be forced to produce almost all of that power aerobically, which will push your lungs to their very limit.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis is the optimal time to stress your body\u2019s ability to produce power at threshold. With your AC depleted (and your lungs and heart working near maximal capacity), the shorter sustained efforts that would normally be a piece of cake will have a bit more...sting. No matter what your preferred discipline, terrain, or distance, this session will make you fitter and faster.\n\n\u200B\n\nFeaturing exciting, on-bike camera footage from the Velon Hammer Series, _The Chores_ will make you earn your keep.\n",

This session is similar to The Trick, with a few differences. On the plus side, all of the efforts are 15-seconds shorter than those in The Trick. To make up for this, we added two more intervals to this session, bringing the total to 6. That means by the end of this session you will have plowed through 4.5-minutes of AC work.\n\nThis workout is one of the few sessions that we do NOT recommend you complete in ERG mode if you are on a smart trainer. The goal is to hold onto the highest power you can for the full 45-seconds. Inevitably in the later sets, your power will dip before you reach the end of the interval. What we want is for you to complete every effort having given everything for 45-seconds. We don\u0027t want ERG mode grinding you to a halt because you cannot maintain the (ridiculously) high power targets. Even if you drop down below FTP in the final 10-seconds of these efforts, as long as you are going flat out, you are doing it correctly.\n\nJust take this session one interval at a time, and focus on giving your all for this one effort. You can worry about the others when you get to them.

The only time we would suggest Erg mode is if you are unable to maintain the lower power targets set between sprints.\n\n\u200B\n\nWith short maximal sprint efforts, you\u0027ll recruit every muscle fiber you have in your legs each effort. While cadence builds force your muscles to contract and relax as quickly as possible, this session forces your muscles to contract with maximal force. Just like cadence builds this session becomes one of the best ways to train your neuromuscular system. Even if your target event does not require you to complete maximal sprints, there is a substantial trickle-down effect to the longer duration power efforts when you train your neuromuscular system.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session is a great alternate to cadence builds or standing starts for those completing our SUF Strength sessions. On days you complete off the bike strength work you want your on bike training to complement the suffering you put yourself through off the bike. That means short maximal efforts (whether for power or for cadence) are the best workouts to complement the strength gains you\u0027ve made off the bike.\n\n\u200B\n\nAs long as you run this session in slope mode you can complete the sprints either seated or out of the saddle. For those competing in events that do not require much (if any) standing (such as Time Trials or Triathalons) you should complete this sprints seated (and in the aerobars or drops if that is where you are racing).\n\n\u200B\n\nYou should also do these efforts seated if you don\u0027t feel an out-of-the-saddle maximal sprint is stable/safe to do on your trainer. Regardless of using ERG or Slope mode, you do not want to hold anything back on any sprint. Seeing your peak power drop as the session goes on is totally normal as your legs fatigue. This is where RPE really becomes the most important metric, rather than power, heart rate, or cadence.

              "description": "The goal of this workout is to help develop your baseline aerobic fitness. While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high and your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week. Shorter Endurance rides (like this one) can fit in both a hard week of training and a recovery week. That is, only if you do it right! Most people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022\n\n\u200B\n\nTruth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride, especially one under 90 minutes should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted.\n\nSo what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like? For 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70%, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in low to mid Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can; for most this is 80-90rpm. Also, your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster, but you will have to trust us on this one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions, or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: 4\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nNA\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

This is an honest look at the demands of a legendary ultra-endurance race and what one finds out on the road.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: This is a great way to watch a compelling documentary while developing your baseline aerobic fitness. The intensity of this workout will vary mostly between 60-70% of FTP, with heart rate remaining entirely in zone 2. This session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s how to turn off on-screen graphics for the best viewing experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterInspiration)\n",

But since few of us can put down pro-level watts, we made it so all of the efforts are scaled to your own personal 4DP\u00AE profile. That means you get to experience exactly what the pros experience relative to your own abilities. When they sprint, you sprint. When they attack, you attack.

              "description": "The goal of this workout is to help develop your baseline aerobic fitness. While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are just times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right!\n\n\u200B\n\nMost people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022 Truth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted. So what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like?\n\nFor 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70% is ok, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm and your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster. You will have to trust us on that one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions! Or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 11\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 1\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

Cadence builds improve how you recruit your leg, gluteal, and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke by progressing to your maximal cadence. By reaching your highest cadence possible, you are training the \u0027on/off\u0027 switch in each muscle group to not only work faster but to have less overlap with your other muscle groups. This session trains your hamstring muscles to \u0027turn off\u0027 when your quads \u0027turn on\u0027 and vice-versa, resulting in a more efficient pedal stroke at both high and low cadences.\n\n\u200B\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to The Knowledge podcast, by Wahoo Sports Science - The Benefits of High Cadence Training: [https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence](https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence)\n",

              "description": "You can never have too many tools in the shed. After years of lobbying, we finally convinced Grunter von Agony to share his favorite set of implements with us: the fabled _14 Vise Grips_. Taken individually, each of the 14 intervals might appear tame, incapable of inflicting a significant squeeze. But when expertly applied in the correct order, they apply just the right kind of pressure to turn a Couchlandrian into a Sufferlandrian, just like turning coal into diamonds.\n\n\u200B\n\nWhile the duration of each Vise Grip varies (from 30 seconds to 2 minutes), the power targets and recovery durations between them remain constant. The first 30-second interval should feel like a Sunday stroll in the park, but by the end of the first 2-minute Vise Grip, you\u0027ll be cursing Grunter\u0027s name. As the intervals get shorter, time will appear to stretch. That final 30-second effort will feel like an eternity. When you roll up to the second set, you\u0027ll know what you\u0027re in for, so just put your head down and prepare yourself to crush or be crushed.\n\n\u200B\n\nOnce you make it through all 14 Vise Grips, you will have been north of your Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) for a total of 16 minutes. Changing the duration of the efforts (while keeping the same recovery) stresses your Anaerobic Capacity (AC) in a more dynamic way than, say, a more straightforward on/off session like _Half is Easy_. Since the longer efforts have the same recovery duration as the shorter ones, you will eventually deplete your AC, forcing your body to rely on your MAP to hit the required power targets. As the intervals get shorter in the second half of each set, you\u0027ll find that you have just enough left in the tank to complete the next effort.\n\n\u200B\n\nUltimately this workout combines the advantages of shorter, higher-power intervals with longer recovery (great for building muscular strength) with the advantages of longer, higher-power intervals with inadequate recovery (great for driving up your MAP and improving your AC).\n",

While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are just times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right! Most people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022\n\n\u200B\n\nTruth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted. So what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like? For 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70% is ok, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm. Also, your RPE should be a 2-4.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster. You will have to trust us on that one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions! Or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 7\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 1\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C85%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

Cadence builds improve how you recruit your leg, gluteal, and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke by progressing to your maximal cadence. By reaching your highest cadence possible, you are training the \u0027on/off\u0027 switch in each muscle group to not only work faster but to have less overlap with your other muscle groups.

The term \u0022Taper\u0022 refers to how you train in the week or so before your target event to ensure you deliver your best performance. Generally, tapering means reducing your total training volume but continuing to hit some high-intensity efforts. While there are individual variations in the best way to taper, this session has been used by countless professionals leading into the biggest races of their lives -- athletes like World Champions Rohan Dennis and Flora Duffy.\n\n\u200B\n\nWith 3 sets of micro-intervals (40/20s, 30/30s, and 20/40s) you will hit your system with just enough intensity to keep your legs sharp and responsive, without adding any real fatigue. Outside of those 3 sets of micro-intervals, this session is purposefully short and easy. This is a preparation session, not a training session! After all, your event is just around the corner and all of the important training is behind you. Riding harder or longer today will do absolutely nothing to increase your fitness by event day; in fact, all that would do is increase your fatigue, which will only hurt your performance. Rather, this session makes sure your body is humming along and ready to perform on the big day.\n",

Developed by Head of Wahoo Sports Science Coach Neal Henderson, Full Frontal uses the same lab-verified testing protocol that Coach Neal has used at the highest level for over a decade with professional and amateur athletes.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis test will provide you with a complete Four-Dimensional Power profile, identify your Rider Type, and tell you exactly what aspects of your fitness you need to focus on to become a more complete cyclist. More importantly, SYSTM will then use your results to set personalized power targets for all of your workouts based on your unique profile, resulting in the most precise, effective workouts available. Your results will also be used to tailor all of your training plans.\n\n\u200B\n\nWe recommend re-testing with Full Frontal every 8-12 weeks or as prescribed by your training plan.\n\n\u200B\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to \u0027[Why Fitness Testing Matters](https://the-knowledge-by-wahoo-sports-science.simplecast.com/episodes/testing-testing-1-2-3-why-fitness-testing-matters)\u0027 on The Knowledge Podcast by Wahoo Sports Science\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s some more information on how to get the most from your fitness test.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterFitnessAssessment)\n",

To prepare for this pose, the routine focuses on mobilizing the spine and shoulders and opening up the fronts of the hips.
