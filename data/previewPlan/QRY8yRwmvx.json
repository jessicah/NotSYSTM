      "description": "#### **Special Focus: Upper Body Level 2**\n\nThis six week training plan is specifically designed to improve your upper body strength and mobility that is often overlooked in endurance athletes. If you are currently in an off-season build or a mid-season bump, with three short focused sessions per week, this plan is ideal.  The combination of strength and yoga sessions will target your shoulders, chest, arms, upper back, and core muscles to help you become a well rounded athlete.\n\n\u200B\n\nLevel 2 is ideal if you have recently completed Level 1 or are returning from a three to six month lay-off. As with any of the SYSTM strength plans, take your time with each session and follow the proper progression to experience results.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis plan may be applied in conjunction with other Special Focused strength plans, such as Dynamic Focus or combined with one of the 12 week strength add-ons. However, If you choose to apply concurrent plans we suggest that you do so during the off-season or at a time when your endurance training volume is low.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe Special Focus stand alone plans follow a 2:1 progression and have three sessions per week on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.\n\n\u200B\n\nTime to rock!\n",

This sequence will be beneficial for endurance sports where you need some upper body strength and improved posture, such as swimming, cycling (especially MTB and Cyclocross), and running. To help ensure overall strength, this routine incorporates some core muscle exercises and you may find some portions of the sequence difficult. No problem! Take your time to understand the movement.

We\u2019re going to continue the focus on increasing strength in the chest, back, shoulders and arms. Many of the exercises will be familiar from Level 1, but you\u2019ll likely find it a bit more challenging. That\u2019s because we\u2019ve made the durations a bit longer and the moves a little more complex. Challenge yourself to maintain quality repetitions throughout the sequence and strive for a full range of motion.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?
