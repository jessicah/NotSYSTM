Located on the flat, fast roads of downtown Adelaide, South Australia this ~45 minute criterium promises to be fast, fun and downright hectic. You\u2019re on board, of course, with Australian National Road Champion Nicole Frain, experiencing exactly what Nicole did and riding exactly as she did, but according to your own power profile. While criteriums aren\u2019t Nicole\u2019s favorite terrain, she\u2019s up for the challenge and is looking for an opportunity to surprise the field and perhaps slip away for the win. Can she \u2013 can you! - do it?\n\n\u200B\n\n**About ProRides**\n\nHere\u2019s your chance to experience what it\u2019s like to ride in the biggest races in the world, thanks to SYSTM\u2019s 4DP platform. We\u2019ve taken the first-person camera footage and power data from a pro cyclist and analyzed it to determine which part of their 4DP\u00AE profile each of their efforts corresponds to. But since few of us can put down pro-level watts, we made it so all of the efforts are scaled to your own personal 4DP\u00AE profile. That means you get to experience exactly what the pros experience relative to your own abilities. When they sprint, you sprint. When they attack, you attack. When they sit up, you get to take it (relatively) easy. It\u0027s the most immersive, realistic race simulation out there.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s some more information on how to create the most immersive ProRides experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterProRides)\n",

At 11km in length, the climb of Els-Angels offers the perfect platform for a solid session, so after we\u2019ve warmed up our legs and the road starts to rise we\u2019ll hit the early slopes at around 80% of FTP and slowly build towards threshold by the summit. That will take about around 30 minutes and you\u0027ll take a moment to catch your breath on the decent before rounding out this 25km day with 3 x 60-second high cadence drills on the way over to P\u00FAbol.\n\n\u200B\n\nStay focussed, hit your numbers and we\u2019ll even have a cold one waiting for you at the finish!

Cash Register is an adaptation of that idea and comes in the format of a sprint/settle/surge session consisting of 4 intervals that get a little shorter (but not easier) each round.\n\n\u200B\n\nEach interval kicks off with a sprint effort that targets your Neuromuscular (NM) power. Then you settle into a controlled, below-FTP effort that will accelerate the rate at which you can clear lactate from your muscles. You\u0027ll finish each effort off with a big surge based on your Anaerobic Capacity (AC). In just 30 minutes, you\u0027ll be doing efforts targeting your sprint power, FTP, and AC for an exceptionally well-rounded workout.\n\n\u200B\n\nSupport the Wahooligan Tour by [donating to the Davis Phinney Foundation](https://secure2.convio.net/dpf/site/TR?pg=pfind\u0026fr_id=1391) and their programs to help people living with Parkinsons.\n",
