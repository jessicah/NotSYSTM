      "description": "#### **Special Focus: Posterior Chain Level 2**\n\nThis six week training plan is specifically designed to improve strength and mobility through the shoulders, back, glutes and hamstrings. With three short focused sessions per week, this is an ideal way to activate your posterior chain, an area typically overlooked with endurance athletes. You can add this plan as an off-season block or as an extra bump to your regular season training.\n\n\u200B\n\nLevel 2 is ideal if you have recently completed Level 1 or are returning from a three to six month lay-off. As with any of the SYSTM strength plans, take your time with each session and follow the proper progression to experience results.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis plan may be applied in conjunction with other Special Focused strength plans, such as Upper Body. However, If you choose to apply concurrent plans we suggest that you do so during the off-season or at a time when your endurance training volume is low.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe Special Focus stand alone plans follow a 2:1 progression and have three sessions per week on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.\n\n\u200B\n\nLet\u0027s get moving!\n",

This includes everything from your powerful glutes, hamstrings, and calves to the postural muscles of your upper back and neck._\n\n\u200B\n\nLike the Previous Posterior Chain sessions, Level 3 targets the muscles of the back side of your body. However, this routine has a greater concentration on upper back and posterior shoulder strength than the earlier sessions. This more advanced combination of movements will challenge your stability and strength endurance. If you find yourself struggling with some of the moves late in the session it\u0027s ok to pause the video and take a breath. Your form is the most important thing here, so don\u2019t push through and get sloppy.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?
