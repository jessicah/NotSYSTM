              "description": "One of the best sessions for neuromuscular training, this drill asks you to progressively build from a cadence of 90 RPM to your MAX over 30 seconds, recover, and repeat several times. Cadence builds improve how you recruit your leg, gluteal, and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke by progressing to your maximal cadence. By reaching your highest cadence possible, you are training the \u0027on/off\u0027 switch in each muscle group to not only work faster but to have less overlap with your other muscle groups. This session trains your hamstring muscles to \u0027turn off\u0027 when your quads \u0027turn on\u0027 and vice-versa, resulting in a more efficient pedal stroke at both high and low cadences.\n\n\u200B\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to The Knowledge podcast, by Wahoo Sports Science - The Benefits of High Cadence Training: [https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence](https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence)\n",

This one may be short but it\u2019ll have you hanging onto the edge of your saddle as we explore the Pilancones Natural Park, high up on a mountain ridge overlooking the Soria valley as we head towards Chira Lake. The goal of this ride will be to work on your good form with a slightly higher cadence than normal, keeping the legs supple and spinning. We\u2019ll gently build the effort up a 3km climb to get the heart, legs and lungs working a little harder before descending to our final destination at Chira Lake. This workout is perfect for those days when you need an easier session or want to activate the body before going deeper.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis workout focusses on a progressive build through the duration of the climb helping with your pacing skills and sustained efforts.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/8773915186)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

We\u2019ll be breaking this 10km climb down into three distinct sections, kicking off with a block of 6 x 50 second high tempo efforts with a 10 second burst out of the saddle before taking a swift breather before getting back on it. As we climb through the pine forest we\u2019ll switch things up a touch, alternating between low and high cadence for 30 seconds at a time for around 7 minutes. We\u2019ll then revert back to our 50 second high tempo with 10 second burst out of the saddle efforts before we build up our effort to the summit. This is going to be a challenging workout so make sure you\u2019re ready and whatever you do don\u2019t forget to take a moment to look at the views!!\n\n\u200B\n\nThis workout combines multiple different interval types that focus on improving threshold power via over-under style efforts along with low cadence work for your muscular endurance. The first and last climbs also fire up your whole energy systems with some sprints to the summit.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/8735613403)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

              "description": "Meandering along the scenic River Iller, it\u2019s time to break out your gravel bike for a classic cadence build and hold session. We\u2019ll kick off with 5 x 30-second cadence builds, allowing for 2 minutes of recovery between each, before moving on to 5 x 60-second cadence holds, again with 2 minutes recovery.\n\nWhile this session may be short, it\u2019s a key part of your weekly plan, designed to keep you efficient and in top form, even when the cadence ramps up. Stay smooth and steady\u2014and remember, \u201Cno bobbing!\u201D\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Builds:** The name of the game here is absolute peak cadence, not peak power. To achieve this, you need to be in a small gear and have very light resistance. Starting at 90-RPM, steadily increase your cadence until you reach your absolute max with about 5-seconds left, and hold that to the end. Your limiting factor on these efforts needs to be leg speed. If resistance/power output is your limiting factor, try starting in an easier gear, or shift into an easier gear 15-seconds in. Bouncing in the saddle is okay for this drill.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Holds**: These efforts require you to maintain the highest cadence you can without starting to bounce in the saddle. For some of you that will be 100-RPM, for others, it will be 150-RPM. The key is to settle into YOUR peak sustainable cadence. Like the Builds, the goal here is not high power, so these efforts are limited to 90% of FTP. Do not be surprised if your heart rate is well into Zone 4 by the time you hit the last few holds.\n\n\nTo properly execute this session, your effort between drills needs to be low. With limited recovery time between these maximal Neuromuscular Efforts, riding above Zone 1 between efforts will only reduce your ability to max out your cadence. While the power targets between are Zone 1, do not be surprised if your heart rate does not drop below Zone 2 after the first couple builds.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/9885886076)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty. As founder of The Col Collective, Mike has made a career out of riding, filming, and telling the story of epic rides and mountains across the continent. As your On Location co-creator and host, Mike\u0027s engaging character, curious mind, and friendly nature will have you cueing up your next ride with him before you\u0027ve even finished the cool-down._\n",

Are you ready to bring intervals back into your routine, but not quite prepared to face up to a session like _Nine Hammers_ or _The Shovel_? Then this is the session for you.\n\n\u200B\n\nIf you love _Recharger_ then you\u0027re going to tough love_ No Place Like Home_ - the perfect re-introduction to a little bit of hard work. It will wake up your legs, lungs and mind, reminding them what it means to dig deep but without really working too hard or for too long. The workout is expertly designed by Wahoo\u0027s Head of Sports Science, Sir Neal Henderson, as a gradual step back into Suffering when self-doubt has taken hold of you and motivation may be low. While you\u2019re riding it, you\u0027ll soon realize that you\u0027re stronger than you think and that you _can_ work hard. You\u0027ll also realize that you really shouldn\u0027t have ever left Sufferlandria -- Border Control takes these things very seriously.\n\n\u200B\n\nAnd when the session is finished? A wave of endorphins kicks in - and if you\u2019ve done it right, you\u0027ll feel a sense of elation and a little sting in the legs that reminds you why you were born to Suffer and why there truly is..._No Place Like Home._\n",

You\u2019ll want to savor every second of those short recoveries. This workout will help improve your FTP and improve your ability to recover while pushing just under your threshold for the first half of each effort. You\u2019ll also learn to manage your pacing and put out power above your threshold after holding steady just below that breakpoint.\n\n\u200B\n\nRiders with sustained weakness will benefit greatly from this workout, as will anyone looking to push up their FTP.\n\n_Attacker_ is quite similar to the SUF workout, _Defender._ However, the efforts within each interval are 2-minutes shorter, and instead of starting harder and backing off like in _Defender,_ the efforts in this session start controlled and keep squeezing harder and harder until the end.\n",

              "description": "This is a technique-focused session designed to develop your agility, stability, range of motion, and foot speed. There is no focus on heart rate zones so you may choose to leave your monitor at home for these sessions. Between sets of each drill, you should jog/walk easily to fully recover between the efforts. While these efforts shouldn\u2019t be too taxing on you, the key is perfect form, so you want to be hitting each one rested enough that you can maintain great form for the duration. You should take a bit of extra rest between techniques, again to ensure you are rested and can nail the form. Before starting the workout, familiarize yourself with the format for high knees, butt kicks, skipping, carioca and strides. Find a flat track, field, or 50-100m of open space to perform this workout (football and soccer fields are great for this).\n\n\u200B\n\nFor help understanding your run workout and calculating your pace zones, please see [this article](https://wahoosystm.com/RunningSessionFAQ).\n\nLearn how to perform your [**Running Drills**](https://support.wahoofitness.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404080091922-Running-Drills) here.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-up:**\n\nStart off with 5-10 minutes of easy jogging/walking.\n\nHigh Knees: 2-3 sets of 50m high knees.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- Take short strides, bringing your knees up high enough that your upper legs are parallel to the ground. Focus on achieving high knees AND quick turnover, or performing as many reps as possible in a short distance.\n\n**Butt Kicks:**\n\n2-3 sets of 50m butt kicks.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- This should actually look similar to a high knee drill, but with the heels coming up to touch the bottom of your butt. Take short strides while using your hamstrings to lift your heels up beneath your butt. Your knees should come up in front of your body while pulling your heels up beneath your hips, rather than keeping your quads and knees below and in line with your hips.\n\n**Skipping:**\n\n3-4 sets of 50m skipping.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- Focus on a high knee drive and swinging your arms at your sides like you would when running.\n\n**Carioca:**\n\n4 sets of 30m Carioca in each direction (8 total).\n\nRest for 20 seconds between direction changes (at your discretion).\n\n- For this drill, you need to face sidewise to the direction you want to go. Start off moving to the right. Bring your left knee up and across your body and put your left foot in front of your right foot. Step your right foot to the right so it is parallel with your left leg again (at this point you should be positioned in the same direction and orientation that you were at the start. Next step your left leg behind your right leg, again so it lands on the right side of your right leg. Then bring your right leg back across your body, once again ending up in the starting position. Repeat this pattern for 25-30m.\n\n**Strides:**\n\n2-3 sets of 60m; Gradually build effort from RPE 3-8.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between. These are comprised of a steady acceleration over 60-80m up to 5k pace. The goal is to increase speed after each step, so you are reaching maximum speed at the end of the 60-80m stretch. You want to focus on keeping your shoulders, neck, and jaw relaxed while maintaining strong knee drive, straight and compact arm swing, planting the feet beneath the hips, and fast turnover.\n\n\u200B\n\nHigh Knees \u002B Butt Kicks:\n\nFinish these drills with one set each of 50m high knees and butt kicks.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool-down:**\n\nWalk or jog for 5 minutes to cool down.\n\nIn case you need to brush up on your running [drills](https://wahoosystm.com/RunningSessionFAQ)\n",

It explores extraordinary personal stories of ordinary cyclists taking on iconic endurance event Chase The Sun, revealing the power of the humble bicycle to transform lives and help save the planet.\n\nThe film features contributions from broadcaster and ITV\u2019s voice of the Tour de France Ned Boulting, author and blogger Jools Walker, Turner Prize-winning artist Sir Richard Long and 4x Mountain Bike World Champion Tracy Moseley.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: the workout accompanying this film varies from endurance to tempo to sub-threshold. The higher intensity efforts aren\u0027t the hardest you\u0027ll experience so that you can keep your attention on the film, however, they are just hard enough to help improve your FTP, oxygen utilization efficiency, and the ability to recover quickly between hard efforts. The workout intensity reflects the intensity of the riders in many places, so you may feel as if you\u0027re climbing Mont Ventoux or that you\u0027re a part of Cav\u0027s lead-out train on the run into the finish line.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s how to turn off on-screen graphics for the best viewing experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterInspiration)\n",

              "description": "This session is all about high-torque efforts, very similar to the efforts you would experience riding up the steep slopes of Mt Sufferlandria. While these efforts are short and the intensity isn\u2019t too high, the low cadence targets combined with minimal recovery will leave some begging for the high-cadence sprints of _The Omnium_. High-torque efforts like these have two primary benefits: improved neuromuscular coordination and increased muscular endurance.\n\n\u200B\n\nDuring each pedal revolution, your legs have to \u201Cswitch on\u201D and \u201Cswitch off\u201D almost all of the muscles in your legs. High-cadence efforts in something like _Cadence Builds_ are great for teaching these groups to make that switch quickly. These low-cadence efforts are better for teaching ALL of the muscles in your legs to \u201Cswitch on.\u201D Done properly, you should be pulling with your hamstrings with one leg while the other leg is pushing down with all the force your glutes and quads can muster. If you feel like you are pushing yourself up out of the saddle during harder efforts (like seated sprints), your hamstrings are not being utilized since they should pull you back down into your saddle.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe second main benefit is improved muscular endurance. Even though the session is under 45 minutes, **you\u0027ll put a similar amount of muscular fatigue into your legs as a steady, multi-hour base ride.** You can almost view this session as hitting the leg press for 8 sets of 100 reps. And just like the weight room, proper form is absolutely key. That means:\n\n- You should focus on pushing down AND pulling back up. You want your glutes and quads activated on the way down and your hamstring and hip flexors activated on the way up.\n- To properly engage your hamstrings think about trying to pulling your heel up to your butt when your crank arm is going from 6 o\u2019clock to 10 o\u2019clock.\n- Your knees should be tracking straight up and down, no collapsing in or out.\n- Your core should be fully engaged to keep your hips steady in the saddle. This will be easier if you are both pushing and pulling during each pedal revolution.\n\nThis session is very similar to _Power Station_. Both help improve your muscular endurance and coordination; the biggest difference is the work to rest ratio between the two. While the intervals here are shorter than those in _Power Station_, the decreased recovery duration means fatigue will build faster, especially for those with a weakness in repeated efforts.\n\nModifying interval length and recovery duration can also be seen between sessions like _Revolver_ and _A Very Dark Place_. Both serve up a healthy dose of MAP/VO2 work, but the overall feeling of those two sessions is different.\n\nIf you find that your lower back starts to ache during this session or that you have to start rocking in the saddle to keep the power up, then it\u2019s time for you to get started on the SYSTM Yoga program. Kick it off with \u201CCore Strengtheners \u201D to make sure your core is just as strong as those legs.\n\n\u200B\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to \u0027[When to Train with Low Cadence](https://the-knowledge-by-wahoo-sports-science.simplecast.com/episodes/when-to-train-with-low-cadence)\u0027 on The Knowledge Podcast by Wahoo Sports Science.\n",

              "description": "This is a technique-focused session designed to develop your agility, stability, range of motion, and foot speed. There is no focus on heart rate zones so you may choose to leave your monitor at home for these sessions. Between sets of each drill, you should jog/walk easily to fully recover between the efforts. While these efforts shouldn\u2019t be too taxing on you, the key is perfect form, so you want to be hitting each one rested enough that you can maintain great form for the duration. You should take a bit of extra rest between techniques, again to ensure you are rested and can nail the form. Before starting the workout, familiarize yourself with the format for high knees, butt kicks, skipping, carioca and strides. Find a flat track, field, or 50-100m of open space to perform this workout (football and soccer fields are great for this).\n\n\u200B\n\nFor help understanding your run workout and calculating your pace zones, please see [this article](https://wahoosystm.com/RunningSessionFAQ).\n\nLearn how to perform your [**Running Drills**](https://support.wahoofitness.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404080091922-Running-Drills) here.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-up:**\n\nStart off with 5-10 minutes of easy jogging/walking.\n\nHigh Knees: 2-3 sets of 50m high knees.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- Take short strides, bringing your knees up high enough that your upper legs are parallel to the ground. Focus on achieving high knees AND quick turnover, or performing as many reps as possible in a short distance.\n\n**Butt Kicks:**\n\n2-3 sets of 50m butt kicks.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- This should actually look similar to a high knee drill, but with the heels coming up to touch the bottom of your butt. Take short strides while using your hamstrings to lift your heels up beneath your butt. Your knees should come up in front of your body while pulling your heels up beneath your hips, rather than keeping your quads and knees below and in line with your hips.\n\n**Skipping:**\n\n3-4 sets of 50m skipping.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- Focus on a high knee drive and swinging your arms at your sides like you would when running.\n\n**Carioca:**\n\n4 sets of 30m Carioca in each direction (8 total).\n\nRest for 20 seconds between direction changes (at your discretion).\n\n- For this drill, you need to face sidewise to the direction you want to go. Start off moving to the right. Bring your left knee up and across your body and put your left foot in front of your right foot. Step your right foot to the right so it is parallel with your left leg again (at this point you should be positioned in the same direction and orientation that you were at the start. Next step your left leg behind your right leg, again so it lands on the right side of your right leg. Then bring your right leg back across your body, once again ending up in the starting position. Repeat this pattern for 25-30m.\n\n**Strides:**\n\n2-3 sets of 60m; Gradually build effort from RPE 3-8.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between. These are comprised of a steady acceleration over 60-80m up to 5k pace. The goal is to increase speed after each step, so you are reaching maximum speed at the end of the 60-80m stretch. You want to focus on keeping your shoulders, neck, and jaw relaxed while maintaining strong knee drive, straight and compact arm swing, planting the feet beneath the hips, and fast turnover.\n\n\u200B\n\nHigh Knees \u002B Butt Kicks:\n\nFinish these drills with one set each of 50m high knees and butt kicks.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool-down:**\n\nWalk or jog for 5 minutes to cool down.\n\nIn case you need to brush up on your running [drills](https://wahoosystm.com/RunningSessionFAQ)\n",

In the first of a series of behind-the-scenes, unfiltered front-row access with team Lifeplus-Wahoo, MADE THIS is a collection of short films from MAAP Pro Team Racing that reveals what it takes to make a champion a champion.\n2. **Prepared for anything: **The excitement of Holy Week at the Tour de Flanders is upon us, and Team Lifeplus-Wahoo is gearing up for a challenging ride. With 163km to conquer, featuring 12 climbs and seven cobbled stretches, not to mention seven slippery flat stone sections\u2014all under a deluge of rain\u2014anything could happen.\n3. **Passion on the cobbles: **Join us as we dive deep into the chaotic and exhilarating world of the Paris-Roubaix, one of cycling\u0027s most grueling races. Amidst the cobblestones and mud, Team Lifeplus-Wahoo faces the ultimate test of endurance and skill. With a new lineup and high stakes, the team navigates the unpredictable nature of this legendary race, where luck can play a huge role and every second counts.\n4. **Home sweet home: **After a fallow year for the tour, the team are eager to push for results in front of an expectant crowd. But instead of the warm welcome on familiar roads, disaster strikes the first morning of the race. As national news of the unfortunate event breaks, the team are left wondering if they\u0027ll be able to compete or if this becomes a home visit to forget. What follows is a true act of human kindness and a gesture that symbolises the unifying bond of the women\u0027s pro peloton.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: The workout accompanying this film is a recovery session. It\u0027s a very low-intensity ride, with your power remaining at or below 50% of FTP (an RPE less than 2.5 on a scale from 1 to 10) and your heart rate in Zone 1.

The 22km climb is long, so we break it up into three sections for you. First, you\u0027ll have a nice long warm-up to ride into the village of Fabian. Once the proper climb starts, you\u0027ll ramp it up to a range between 70-90% threshold and hold it there. Toward the end, you\u0027ll start to work hard and finish off with an all-out assault on the summit. Along the way, you\u0027ll find out how the local wool is processed, how a network of ancient towers protected the region, why one house is covered in flowers, and what happened to all the local brown bears.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/3778259865)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty. As founder of The Col Collective, Mike has made a career out of riding, filming, and telling the story of epic rides and mountains across the continent. As your On Location co-creator and host, Mike\u0027s engaging character, curious mind, and friendly nature will have you cueing up your next ride with him before you\u0027ve even finished the cool-down._\n",

While it\u0027s not as comprehensive or as accurate as our main fitness test, _Full Frontal_, it\u0027s far more approachable and easier to pace for new riders. It also doesn\u0027t require any special preparation. You just need to feel relatively fresh.\n\n\u200B\n\nBased on more than a year of research (and after dozens of lab tests and thousands of online tests) and using sophisticated analysis of power and heart rate data, _Half Monty_ is far more accurate and comprehensive than standard ramp tests.\n\n\u200B\n\nIt also tells you more about who you are as an athlete. _Half Monty_ provides you with your FTP, Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP), and Cycling Threshold Heart Rate (cTHR), all of which we use to personalize your workout targets.\n\n\u200B\n\nIf you\u0027re still using the 4DP estimates when you set up your account, _Half Monty_ will also refine your AC and NM estimates (but will not do so if you\u0027ve done _Full Frontal_ or manually adjusted your estimates). If you want fully accurate AC and NM, as well as your Rider Type, Strengths, Weaknesses, and training plans adjusted to those Strengths and Weaknesses, you\u0027ll need to expose yourself to the _Full Frontal_ 4DP fitness test.\n\n\u200B\n\nReady to climb the ramp? You\u0027ll need the following before you start:\n\n- A heart rate monitor if you want the most accurate results. Don\u0027t have one? Order one [HERE](https://wahoofitness.com/devices)\n- Some kind of power device connected (trainer, power meter, virtual power, etc.)\n- Be ready to pay close attention to the instructions in the workout\n- Be sure your profile is complete and up-to-date (Profile \u003E About You). Accurate information helps us make our calculations\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to \u0027[Why Fitness Testing Matters](https://the-knowledge-by-wahoo-sports-science.simplecast.com/episodes/testing-testing-1-2-3-why-fitness-testing-matters)\u0027 on The Knowledge Podcast by Wahoo Sports Science.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s some more information on how to get the most from your fitness test.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterFitnessAssessment)\n",

              "description": "This is a technique-focused session designed to develop your agility, stability, range of motion, and foot speed. There is no focus on heart rate zones so you may choose to leave your monitor at home for these sessions. Between sets of each drill, you should jog/walk easily to fully recover between the efforts. While these efforts shouldn\u2019t be too taxing on you, the key is perfect form, so you want to be hitting each one rested enough that you can maintain great form for the duration. You should take a bit of extra rest between techniques, again to ensure you are rested and can nail the form. Before starting the workout, familiarize yourself with the format for high knees, butt kicks, skipping, carioca and strides. Find a flat track, field, or 50-100m of open space to perform this workout (football and soccer fields are great for this).\n\n\u200B\n\nFor help understanding your run workout and calculating your pace zones, please see [this article](https://wahoosystm.com/RunningSessionFAQ).\n\nLearn how to perform your [**Running Drills**](https://support.wahoofitness.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404080091922-Running-Drills) here.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-up:**\n\nStart off with 5-10 minutes of easy jogging/walking.\n\nHigh Knees: 2-3 sets of 50m high knees.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- Take short strides, bringing your knees up high enough that your upper legs are parallel to the ground. Focus on achieving high knees AND quick turnover, or performing as many reps as possible in a short distance.\n\n**Butt Kicks:**\n\n2-3 sets of 50m butt kicks.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- This should actually look similar to a high knee drill, but with the heels coming up to touch the bottom of your butt. Take short strides while using your hamstrings to lift your heels up beneath your butt. Your knees should come up in front of your body while pulling your heels up beneath your hips, rather than keeping your quads and knees below and in line with your hips.\n\n**Skipping:**\n\n3-4 sets of 50m skipping.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- Focus on a high knee drive and swinging your arms at your sides like you would when running.\n\n**Carioca:**\n\n4 sets of 30m Carioca in each direction (8 total).\n\nRest for 20 seconds between direction changes (at your discretion).\n\n- For this drill, you need to face sidewise to the direction you want to go. Start off moving to the right. Bring your left knee up and across your body and put your left foot in front of your right foot. Step your right foot to the right so it is parallel with your left leg again (at this point you should be positioned in the same direction and orientation that you were at the start. Next step your left leg behind your right leg, again so it lands on the right side of your right leg. Then bring your right leg back across your body, once again ending up in the starting position. Repeat this pattern for 25-30m.\n\n**Strides:**\n\n2-3 sets of 60m; Gradually build effort from RPE 3-8.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between. These are comprised of a steady acceleration over 60-80m up to 5k pace. The goal is to increase speed after each step, so you are reaching maximum speed at the end of the 60-80m stretch. You want to focus on keeping your shoulders, neck, and jaw relaxed while maintaining strong knee drive, straight and compact arm swing, planting the feet beneath the hips, and fast turnover.\n\n\u200B\n\nHigh Knees \u002B Butt Kicks:\n\nFinish these drills with one set each of 50m high knees and butt kicks.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool-down:**\n\nWalk or jog for 5 minutes to cool down.\n\nIn case you need to brush up on your running [drills](https://wahoosystm.com/RunningSessionFAQ)\n",

That\u0027s why Grunter von Agony, Sufferlandrian Team Director, is sending you to compete in The Omnium at the UCI World Track Championships. Over the course of 50 minutes, you\u0027ll do battle in the six different races.\n\n\u200B\n\nNo two intervals in this workout are the same, with each one working slightly different Neuromuscular (NM), Anaerobic Capacity (AC), and Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) variations. No need for FTP here, friends. It\u0027s the perfect session to improve top-end power without having to do a ton of repetitive efforts.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe Scratch Race and Flying Lap have an easy enough lead-in that you get to put your max sprint to the full test. Add in the standing starts for the Individual Pursuit and Kilo, and you give your NM a real run-through. The repeated surges of the Elimination Race, the all-out nature of the Kilo, and the massive efforts you have to make in the points race really test your powers of recovery while working your AC all the way to the max.\n\n\u200B\n\nSince the efforts come in quick succession, and with most being over four minutes in length, your cardiovascular system never catches a real break, ensuring your MAP doesn\u2019t get left out of the equation.\n",

The blend between mind and body, working together to overcome hard moments\u2014be it physical, mental or emotional\u2014and how we learn to cope in our own mind is essential in being able to process the past, be true to ourselves in the present, and create moments of inner peace in the future.\n\n\u200B\n\nA decade after crossing the French Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es non-stop on a ride that would act as a catalyst for change, I wanted to share this story for the first time. To give an insight into the deeper meaning behind some of the mountain challenges you may have seen me undertake over the years, I felt now was the time to head back to my mountains, return to source, and embrace the unknown.\n\n\u200B\n\nOvercoming the mountains of our mind, from escapism to reconnection. 10 years, 10 cols and 10,000 meters of climbing. This is my story of going Full Circle.\n\n\u200B\n\nThank you for watching. I truly hope there is something in this video that can help you in your own journey.\n\n\u200B\n\nPeace,\n\nMike Cotty\u0022\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: The workout accompanying this film is a recovery session, which is a very low-intensity ride. It\u0027s so easy that your power remains at or below 50% of FTP or an RPE less than 2.5, and your heart rate stays in zone 1 the entire time. The intensity and cadence targets will vary throughout this session to keep it interesting (But not so interesting that you can\u0027t pay attention to the film).\n",

              "description": "Do you have Couchlandrian Tendencies? This short but powerful workout will cure you of that affliction and reassert your inner Sufferlandrian. The session is based on a combination of specific micro-intervals (made famous by Japanese coach and physiologist Izumi Tabata) that we combined with classic tempo efforts. This gives you a superb mix of Anaerobic Capacity (AC), Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP), and FTP training stresses in one short workout to help you go faster and stay stronger for longer.\n\n\u200B\n\nNow, for the sports science purists among you, the \u0027Tabata\u0027 intervals should actually be named \u0027Koichi\u0027 intervals, since it was Japanese speedskating coach Irisawa Koichi who first employed the use of the 20-seconds on / 10-seconds off intervals that Dr. Izumi then confirmed via physiology lab studies to yield the best mix of maximal aerobic and anaerobic stress among the different on/off protocols that he tested.\n\n\u200B\n\nFor this workout, we have toned down the original intensity of the Tabata intervals to target MAP rather than Anaerobic Capacity in order to be able to complete the 20/10 micro-intervals and then follow the short efforts immediately with sustained 80-100% of FTP intervals to replicate the kind of attack and then settle efforts that are common in cycling races.\n\n\u200B\n\nFrom a physiological perspective, you\u2019ll produce lots of lactate during the micro-intervals. Then the goal of the tempo and FTP efforts is to stress your body\u2019s capacity to clear that lactate as quickly as possible. Effectively, we\u2019re trying to maximize lactate \u0027flux.\u0027 For each successive round of the efforts, you\u2019ll do one less micro-interval, and the tempo efforts will get shorter. But because you\u2019re a Sufferlandrian, they won\u2019t get easier, and the rest between sets will get shorter. The intensity for the tempo efforts will ramp up with each repetition. Fortunately for you, there are only 3 sets of efforts and you\u2019ll be done in just 30 minutes. If you\u2019ve set aside an hour for this workout, you\u2019ll be happy to have those additional 30 minutes for recovery after this session.\n",

What would it take? What was realistic? What was possible? Follow Jack\u0027s journey as he battles the elements, the vagaries of the route, and intense mental and physical fatigue to arrive at the Champs-\u00C9lys\u00E9es in Paris.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: The workout accompanying this film is a recovery session, which is a very low-intensity ride.

The intensity and cadence targets will vary throughout this session to keep it interesting (But not so interesting that you can\u0027t pay attention to the film).\n",

              "description": "One of the best sessions for neuromuscular training, this drill asks you to progressively build from a cadence of 90 RPM to your MAX over 30 seconds, recover, and repeat several times. Cadence builds improve how you recruit your leg, gluteal, and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke by progressing to your maximal cadence. By reaching your highest cadence possible, you are training the \u0027on/off\u0027 switch in each muscle group to not only work faster but to have less overlap with your other muscle groups. This session trains your hamstring muscles to \u0027turn off\u0027 when your quads \u0027turn on\u0027 and vice-versa, resulting in a more efficient pedal stroke at both high and low cadences.\n\n\u200B\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to The Knowledge podcast, by Wahoo Sports Science - The Benefits of High Cadence Training: [https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence](https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence)\n",

The term \u0022Taper\u0022 refers to how you train in the week or so before your target event to ensure you deliver your best performance. Generally, tapering means reducing your total training volume but continuing to hit some high-intensity efforts. While there are individual variations in the best way to taper, this session has been used by countless professionals leading into the biggest races of their lives -- athletes like World Champions Rohan Dennis and Flora Duffy.\n\n\u200B\n\nWith 3 sets of micro-intervals (40/20s, 30/30s, and 20/40s) you will hit your system with just enough intensity to keep your legs sharp and responsive, without adding any real fatigue. Outside of those 3 sets of micro-intervals, this session is purposefully short and easy. This is a preparation session, not a training session! After all, your event is just around the corner and all of the important training is behind you. Riding harder or longer today will do absolutely nothing to increase your fitness by event day; in fact, all that would do is increase your fatigue, which will only hurt your performance. Rather, this session makes sure your body is humming along and ready to perform on the big day.\n",

              "description": "This is a technique-focused session designed to develop your agility, stability, range of motion, and foot speed. There is no focus on heart rate zones so you may choose to leave your monitor at home for these sessions. Between sets of each drill, you should jog/walk easily to fully recover between the efforts. While these efforts shouldn\u2019t be too taxing on you, the key is perfect form, so you want to be hitting each one rested enough that you can maintain great form for the duration. You should take a bit of extra rest between techniques, again to ensure you are rested and can nail the form. Before starting the workout, familiarize yourself with the format for high knees, butt kicks, skipping, carioca and strides. Find a flat track, field, or 50-100m of open space to perform this workout (football and soccer fields are great for this).\n\n\u200B\n\nFor help understanding your run workout and calculating your pace zones, please see [this article](https://wahoosystm.com/RunningSessionFAQ).\n\nLearn how to perform your [**Running Drills**](https://support.wahoofitness.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404080091922-Running-Drills) here.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-up:**\n\nStart off with 5-10 minutes of easy jogging/walking.\n\nHigh Knees: 2-3 sets of 50m high knees.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- Take short strides, bringing your knees up high enough that your upper legs are parallel to the ground. Focus on achieving high knees AND quick turnover, or performing as many reps as possible in a short distance.\n\n**Butt Kicks:**\n\n2-3 sets of 50m butt kicks.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- This should actually look similar to a high knee drill, but with the heels coming up to touch the bottom of your butt. Take short strides while using your hamstrings to lift your heels up beneath your butt. Your knees should come up in front of your body while pulling your heels up beneath your hips, rather than keeping your quads and knees below and in line with your hips.\n\n**Skipping:**\n\n3-4 sets of 50m skipping.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- Focus on a high knee drive and swinging your arms at your sides like you would when running.\n\n**Carioca:**\n\n4 sets of 30m Carioca in each direction (8 total).\n\nRest for 20 seconds between direction changes (at your discretion).\n\n- For this drill, you need to face sidewise to the direction you want to go. Start off moving to the right. Bring your left knee up and across your body and put your left foot in front of your right foot. Step your right foot to the right so it is parallel with your left leg again (at this point you should be positioned in the same direction and orientation that you were at the start. Next step your left leg behind your right leg, again so it lands on the right side of your right leg. Then bring your right leg back across your body, once again ending up in the starting position. Repeat this pattern for 25-30m.\n\n**Strides:**\n\n2-3 sets of 60m; Gradually build effort from RPE 3-8.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between. These are comprised of a steady acceleration over 60-80m up to 5k pace. The goal is to increase speed after each step, so you are reaching maximum speed at the end of the 60-80m stretch. You want to focus on keeping your shoulders, neck, and jaw relaxed while maintaining strong knee drive, straight and compact arm swing, planting the feet beneath the hips, and fast turnover.\n\n\u200B\n\nHigh Knees \u002B Butt Kicks:\n\nFinish these drills with one set each of 50m high knees and butt kicks.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool-down:**\n\nWalk or jog for 5 minutes to cool down.\n\nIn case you need to brush up on your running [drills](https://wahoosystm.com/RunningSessionFAQ)\n",

For those not yet ready for Wheel, the other poses in this sequence are also effective for addressing muscular imbalances.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe objectives are to increase spinal and shoulder mobility, stretch the abs, chest, and fronts of the shoulders, open up the hip flexors, activate the glutes, and help alleviate lower and upper back pain.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Poses in this session:**\n\n- Supported Bridge\n- Thunderbolt\u2014Shoulder Rolls\n- Kneeling Cat-Cow\n- Puppy\n- Downward Facing Dog\n- Cobra\n- Low Lunge with Shoulder Opener\n- Bridge\n- Wheel\n- Windscreen Wipers\n",
