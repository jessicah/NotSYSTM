It is vital in maintaining optimal posture during cycling and running in addition to water position in swimming. In this first session, we introduce some basic movements that focus on the activation and stabilization of posterior chain muscles. These moves include a combination of eccentric (lengthening), concentric (shortening), and isometric (holding) contractions. They provide your body with the foundation for more demanding moves to come. This is also a good session to come back to if you feel like you could use a quick posterior chain activation or tune-up.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?

Our Full Body Strength series is exactly what you\u2019re after, offering a well-rounded series of exercises that covers the lower body, core, posterior chain, and upper body. With a substantial progression, there\u2019s enough here to keep you busy -- and improving -- for a very long time._\n\n\u200B\n\nThis is the first routine in the Full Body series. It introduces the most basic versions of moves that make up the majority of this program. Some of these moves may seem very basic but we encourage you to focus on perfect form and execution during these early levels so that when we turn up the heat you have things nailed. As you\u0027ll see, all the exercises at the lower levels will progress in a similar fashion going forward. We\u0027re building strength, but also fine-tuning your nervous system. As the program progresses you\u0027ll be asked to complete more difficult variations on each foundational move.\n\n\u200B\n\nAs with all the strength training routines, it helps if you\u2019ve done a warm-up before getting started. That can be one of your favorite yoga routines, riding your bike on the trainer for 5-10 minutes, or doing a personal stretching routine.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?

These moves include a combination of eccentric (lengthening), concentric (shortening), and isometric (holding) contractions.

We\u2019ll also focus on improving mobility, stability, and flexibility in the upper body. So get ready for great body-weight-based routines that focus on quality repetitions, endurance holds, and range of motion challenges._\n\n\u200B\n\nWelcome to the second session in this series. We\u2019re going to continue the focus on increasing strength in the chest, back, shoulders and arms. Many of the exercises will be familiar from Level 1, but you\u2019ll likely find it a bit more challenging. That\u2019s because we\u2019ve made the durations a bit longer and the moves a little more complex. Challenge yourself to maintain quality repetitions throughout the sequence and strive for a full range of motion.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?
