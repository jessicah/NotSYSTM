      "description": "#### Special Focus: Dynamic Level 1\n\nThe six week Dynamic Focus plan is specifically designed to charge up your neuromuscular system, improve coordination, lateral stability and explosiveness to help you become a more efficient and resilient athlete. The three sessions each week will include integrated full body movements that require timing, coordination and strength as well as yoga sessions that will help you improve mobility and flexibility. As always, it is important to follow the progression with the Dynamic series in order to allow for adequate tissue adaptation.\n\n\u200B\n\nLevel 1 is the place to start if you are new to training your lower body or if you are coming back after an extended lay-off of over six months. As with all of the SYSTM strength plans, it is important to take your time and follow the progression in order to allow for adequate tissue adaptation, especially when adding jumping movements.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis plan may be applied in conjunction with other Special Focused strength plans, such as Upper Body or Core Focus but is not recommended in conjunction with Lower Body Focus. If you choose to apply concurrent plans we suggest that you do so during the off-season or at a time when your endurance training volume is low.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe Special Focus stand alone plans follow a 2:1 progression and have three sessions per week on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.\n\n\u200B\n\nLet\u0027s have some fun!\n",
