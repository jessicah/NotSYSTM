Some of these moves may seem very basic but we encourage you to focus on perfect form and execution during these early levels so that when we turn up the heat you have things nailed. As you\u0027ll see, all the exercises at the lower levels will progress in a similar fashion going forward. We\u0027re building strength, but also fine-tuning your nervous system.

Some of these moves may seem very basic but we encourage you to focus on perfect form and execution during these early levels so that when we turn up the heat you have things nailed. As you\u0027ll see, all the exercises at the lower levels will progress in a similar fashion going forward. We\u0027re building strength, but also fine-tuning your nervous system.
