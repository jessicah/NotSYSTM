So nicely, in fact, that you\u2019re ready for a more demanding session. This workout includes compound sets which are more difficult but, most importantly, more beneficial than simply doing more sets of a single move. This is because your nervous system has to work overtime to cope with the variety. The number of reps per set is also higher, which will help drive continuous improvement.\n\n\u200B\n\nSince this is a longer session, you may experience considerable fatigue on your first time through. As a result, pay more attention to your form. Your body will want to use as little energy as possible, which can lead to some bad habits when hitting rep after rep of a single move. Thankfully, the constant variation of the compound sets forces you to stay engaged and helps you keep solid form from start to finish.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?

We\u2019ll also focus on improving mobility, stability, and flexibility in the upper body. So get ready for great body-weight-based routines that focus on quality repetitions, endurance holds, and range of motion challenges._\n\n\u200B\n\nAs the first session in this series, we\u2019re going to introduce you to some basic upper body movements. This sequence will be beneficial for endurance sports where you need some upper body strength and improved posture, such as swimming, cycling (especially MTB and Cyclocross), and running. To help ensure overall strength, this routine incorporates some core muscle exercises and you may find some portions of the sequence difficult. No problem! Take your time to understand the movement. Pause the video if you need to and embrace the process of mastering new exercises.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?
