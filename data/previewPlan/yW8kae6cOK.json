Cadence builds improve how you recruit your leg, gluteal, and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke by progressing to your maximal cadence. By reaching your highest cadence possible, you are training the \u0027on/off\u0027 switch in each muscle group to not only work faster but to have less overlap with your other muscle groups. This session trains your hamstring muscles to \u0027turn off\u0027 when your quads \u0027turn on\u0027 and vice-versa, resulting in a more efficient pedal stroke at both high and low cadences.\n\n\u200B\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to The Knowledge podcast, by Wahoo Sports Science - The Benefits of High Cadence Training: [https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence](https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence)\n",

This session is designed to sharpen muscle activation and improve recovery after intense efforts.\n\nFinish strong, and I\u2019ll see you in Burgberg!\n\n\u200B\n\nWith short near-maximal sprint efforts like these, you\u2019ll recruit all of the muscle fibers in your legs. While cadence builds force your muscles to contract and relax as quickly as possible, this session forces your muscles to contract with maximal power. Just like cadence builds, this session becomes one of the best ways to train your neuromuscular system.\n\nEven if your target event does not require you to complete maximal sprints, there is a substantial trickle-down efficiency effect to the longer-duration power efforts when you train your neuromuscular system.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/9866624296)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

              "description": "This session is all about high-torque efforts, very similar to the efforts you would experience riding up the steep slopes of Mt Sufferlandria. While these efforts are short and the intensity isn\u2019t too high, the low cadence targets combined with minimal recovery will leave some begging for the high-cadence sprints of _The Omnium_. High-torque efforts like these have two primary benefits: improved neuromuscular coordination and increased muscular endurance.\n\n\u200B\n\nDuring each pedal revolution, your legs have to \u201Cswitch on\u201D and \u201Cswitch off\u201D almost all of the muscles in your legs. High-cadence efforts in something like _Cadence Builds_ are great for teaching these groups to make that switch quickly. These low-cadence efforts are better for teaching ALL of the muscles in your legs to \u201Cswitch on.\u201D Done properly, you should be pulling with your hamstrings with one leg while the other leg is pushing down with all the force your glutes and quads can muster. If you feel like you are pushing yourself up out of the saddle during harder efforts (like seated sprints), your hamstrings are not being utilized since they should pull you back down into your saddle.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe second main benefit is improved muscular endurance. Even though the session is under 45 minutes, **you\u0027ll put a similar amount of muscular fatigue into your legs as a steady, multi-hour base ride.** You can almost view this session as hitting the leg press for 8 sets of 100 reps. And just like the weight room, proper form is absolutely key. That means:\n\n- You should focus on pushing down AND pulling back up. You want your glutes and quads activated on the way down and your hamstring and hip flexors activated on the way up.\n- To properly engage your hamstrings think about trying to pulling your heel up to your butt when your crank arm is going from 6 o\u2019clock to 10 o\u2019clock.\n- Your knees should be tracking straight up and down, no collapsing in or out.\n- Your core should be fully engaged to keep your hips steady in the saddle. This will be easier if you are both pushing and pulling during each pedal revolution.\n\nThis session is very similar to _Power Station_. Both help improve your muscular endurance and coordination; the biggest difference is the work to rest ratio between the two. While the intervals here are shorter than those in _Power Station_, the decreased recovery duration means fatigue will build faster, especially for those with a weakness in repeated efforts.\n\nModifying interval length and recovery duration can also be seen between sessions like _Revolver_ and _A Very Dark Place_. Both serve up a healthy dose of MAP/VO2 work, but the overall feeling of those two sessions is different.\n\nIf you find that your lower back starts to ache during this session or that you have to start rocking in the saddle to keep the power up, then it\u2019s time for you to get started on the SYSTM Yoga program. Kick it off with \u201CCore Strengtheners \u201D to make sure your core is just as strong as those legs.\n\n\u200B\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to \u0027[When to Train with Low Cadence](https://the-knowledge-by-wahoo-sports-science.simplecast.com/episodes/when-to-train-with-low-cadence)\u0027 on The Knowledge Podcast by Wahoo Sports Science.\n",

While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are just times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right!\n\n\u200B\n\nMost people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022 Truth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted. So what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like?\n\nFor 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70% is ok, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm and your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster. You will have to trust us on that one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions!

              "description": "Yep, there are good chunks of sub-threshold in here. But what makes this session special are the surges above threshold during each effort. Your body\u0027s ability to clear metabolites and process oxygen doesn\u0027t really change at 90% of FTP and above. What that means it that whether you are at 90% or 100% of FTP your body is clearing those things out at the same rate. It\u0027s just that at FTP your body is producing more of those metabolites that it is capable of clearing.\n\n\u200B\n\nBy surging above FTP you are creating metabolites faster than your body can clear them. If you were to settle into 100% of FTP, you would only be clearing things out at the rate you are producing them. That means whatever you have produced from that surge will just stay there. By dropping just below FTP your body is clearing things out faster than you are producing them. That means that the excess you got from that surge will slowly be cleared out.\n\n\u200B\n\nEach time a surge pops up during this workout, your body should have just about cleared what was made from the last surge. Not only does this push your body\u0027s ability to clear these things to the max, but it also teaches your mind to deal with the discomfort of burning lungs and legs associated with these efforts at or above threshold.\n\n\u200B\n\nA simpler way to think of this is that you are teaching your body and mind to \u0022recover\u0022 just below FTP. Not only does this help bump up your FTP, but it also helps you recover that much faster anytime you let off the gas, whether for a downhill, turn, or finding a good draft. Having the confidence that you can recover while feeling so uncomfortable can mean the difference between hanging onto to a new personal best and completely throwing in the towel.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis is the perfect session to practice your positive thinking from the Mental Toughness Program (If you haven\u0027t checked that out already you definitely should!).\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 5.5 -- 85% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 90-95% of AC (130-180% of FTP)\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 3\n\nRest between sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nInterval repeats per set: 3\n\n\u200B\n\n**Interval**\n\nWork: 30 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\nSteady: 2 minutes 30 seconds @ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n25 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR \u003C70%\n",

              "description": "Meandering along the scenic River Iller, it\u2019s time to break out your gravel bike for a classic cadence build and hold session. We\u2019ll kick off with 5 x 30-second cadence builds, allowing for 2 minutes of recovery between each, before moving on to 5 x 60-second cadence holds, again with 2 minutes recovery.\n\nWhile this session may be short, it\u2019s a key part of your weekly plan, designed to keep you efficient and in top form, even when the cadence ramps up. Stay smooth and steady\u2014and remember, \u201Cno bobbing!\u201D\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Builds:** The name of the game here is absolute peak cadence, not peak power. To achieve this, you need to be in a small gear and have very light resistance. Starting at 90-RPM, steadily increase your cadence until you reach your absolute max with about 5-seconds left, and hold that to the end. Your limiting factor on these efforts needs to be leg speed. If resistance/power output is your limiting factor, try starting in an easier gear, or shift into an easier gear 15-seconds in. Bouncing in the saddle is okay for this drill.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Holds**: These efforts require you to maintain the highest cadence you can without starting to bounce in the saddle. For some of you that will be 100-RPM, for others, it will be 150-RPM. The key is to settle into YOUR peak sustainable cadence. Like the Builds, the goal here is not high power, so these efforts are limited to 90% of FTP. Do not be surprised if your heart rate is well into Zone 4 by the time you hit the last few holds.\n\n\nTo properly execute this session, your effort between drills needs to be low. With limited recovery time between these maximal Neuromuscular Efforts, riding above Zone 1 between efforts will only reduce your ability to max out your cadence. While the power targets between are Zone 1, do not be surprised if your heart rate does not drop below Zone 2 after the first couple builds.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/9885886076)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

As we climb through the pine forest we\u2019ll switch things up a touch, alternating between low and high cadence for 30 seconds at a time for around 7 minutes. We\u2019ll then revert back to our 50 second high tempo with 10 second burst out of the saddle efforts before we build up our effort to the summit.

              "description": "While the single tempo effort you complete in this session is steady in terms of power, it\u0027s the specific cadence targets that set this session apart from other tempo workouts.\n\n\u200B\n\nEven though an effort at 80% of FTP might seem \u0022easy\u0022, the truth is your body is working at processing oxygen and metabolites at nearly the same rate as when you are right at FTP. The difference is that the overall stress on your system when riding tempo is considerably less than while riding at FTP. That means you can either have harder days before or after a tempo session (compared to a threshold session) or you can increase the duration of those tempo efforts to make the overall training stimulus equal (or greater) than completing several repeats right at your FTP.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis tempo effort is divided into 3 segments of equal duration. While the power is the same across all segments, your target cadence starts off low and increases with each new segment from 60rpm, 75rpm and finally 95rpm. Starting with a long block of low cadence should fatigue your muscles from the start of your effort. As the effort builds and you create more fatigue, the increased cadence targets will place a greater demand on your cardiovascular system. That will feel like a nice break given the load you have been putting on your muscular system. The cadence targets in the final segment will force your fatigued muscles to maintain good coordination as the faster cadence requires your muscles to switch \u0022on\u0022 and \u0022off\u0022 at a faster rate. Between the low-RPM sections and the high-RPM work under fatigue, this tempo session not only helps train your FTP, but also benefits your neuromuscular system.\n\n\u200B\n\nYou can expect your heart rate to remain low for the power targets during the low cadence segment at the start. As the effort progresses and you reach the final 10 minutes of the high rpm segment, your heart rate might go over Z3, which is not something to worry about. While this session appears \u0022easy\u0022 at first glance, don\u0027t be surprised if your legs are feeling it the next day.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n30 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 8 -- 105% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of sets: 3\n\nRest between sets: NA\n\nInterval repeats per: NA\n\n**Interval**\n\nBuild 1: 20 minutes @ RPE 5 -- 80% of FTP -- HR \u003C80% at 60rpm\n\nBuild 2: 20 minutes @ RPE 5 -- 80% of FTP -- HR \u003C80% at 75rpm\n\nBuild 3: 20 minutes @ RPE 5 -- 80% of FTP -- HR \u003C80% at 95rpm\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n1 hour 15 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

              "description": "The goal of this workout is to help develop your baseline aerobic fitness. While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are just times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right!\n\n\u200B\n\nMost people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022 Truth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted. So what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like?\n\nFor 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70% is ok, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm and your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster. You will have to trust us on that one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions! Or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 11\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 1\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

Then this is the session for you.\n\n\u200B\n\nIf you love _Recharger_ then you\u0027re going to tough love_ No Place Like Home_ - the perfect re-introduction to a little bit of hard work. It will wake up your legs, lungs and mind, reminding them what it means to dig deep but without really working too hard or for too long. The workout is expertly designed by Wahoo\u0027s Head of Sports Science, Sir Neal Henderson, as a gradual step back into Suffering when self-doubt has taken hold of you and motivation may be low. While you\u2019re riding it, you\u0027ll soon realize that you\u0027re stronger than you think and that you _can_ work hard. You\u0027ll also realize that you really shouldn\u0027t have ever left Sufferlandria -- Border Control takes these things very seriously.\n\n\u200B\n\nAnd when the session is finished? A wave of endorphins kicks in - and if you\u2019ve done it right, you\u0027ll feel a sense of elation and a little sting in the legs that reminds you why you were born to Suffer and why there truly is..._No Place Like Home._\n",

Why? Going above threshold causes a considerable amount of hormonal stress that takes a lot of time to recover from. But you don\u2019t actually have to ride above threshold to improve your FTP. The difference in fitness gains between 30 minutes at 90% of threshold and at 102% of threshold is minimal. Still, the stress on your body from the latter is much greater, and the recovery much longer.\n\n\u200B\n\nThat\u0027s why this session is a key component to any training plan: It gives you enough training stress to help improve your FTP but remains \u0027easy\u0027 enough that you can do it when you\u0027re tired or before a big block of harder efforts.\n",

The only time we would suggest Erg mode is if you are unable to maintain the lower power targets set between sprints.\n\nWith short maximal sprint efforts, you\u0027ll recruit every muscle fiber you have in your legs with each effort. While cadence builds force your muscles to contract and relax as quickly as possible, this session forces your muscles to contract with maximal force. Just like cadence builds this session becomes one of the best ways to train your neuromuscular system. Even if your target event does not require you to complete maximal sprints, there is a substantial trickle-down effect to the longer duration power efforts when you train your neuromuscular system.\n\nThis session is a great alternate to cadence builds or standing starts for those completing our SUF Strength sessions. On days you complete off the bike strength work you want your on bike training to complement the suffering you put yourself through off the bike. That means short maximal efforts (whether for power or for cadence) are the best workouts to complement the strength gains you\u0027ve made off the bike.\n\nAs long as you run this session in slope mode you can complete the sprints either seated or out of the saddle. For those competing in events that do not require much (if any) standing (such as Time Trials or Triathlons) you should complete these sprints seated (and in the aerobars or drops if that is where you are racing).\n\nYou should also do these efforts seated if you don\u0027t feel an out-of-the-saddle maximal sprint is stable/safe to do on your trainer. Regardless of using ERG or Slope mode, you do not want to hold anything back on any sprint. Seeing your peak power drop as the session goes on is totally normal as your legs fatigue. This is where RPE really becomes the most important metric, rather than power, heart rate, or cadence.\n\nNow get on that bike and CRUSH IT!\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of sets: 12\n\nRest between sets: 9 minutes 50 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nInterval repeats per set: NA\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 200% of FTP -- \u003E105%\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

We know you can go harder for 25-minutes, but that is not the point of a Tempo Session.\n\n\u200B\n\nWhat many people don\u0027t realize is that your body\u0027s ability to process oxygen and metabolites is nearly identical from 80%-100% of FTP. The main change across that intensity range is the rate at which those metabolites are being generated. While you would get a slightly greater training load from doing this session at a higher power, you would be adding more fatigue to your system than we want. That extra fatigue means you either need to ease off your workouts in the days leading up, or ease off your workouts on the days after. From a big picture point of view that\u0027s no good! This session gives a great steady-state aerobic training load, while leaving you fresh enough that you can hit training hard the days before and after.

Cash Register is an adaptation of that idea and comes in the format of a sprint/settle/surge session consisting of 4 intervals that get a little shorter (but not easier) each round.\n\n\u200B\n\nEach interval kicks off with a sprint effort that targets your Neuromuscular (NM) power. Then you settle into a controlled, below-FTP effort that will accelerate the rate at which you can clear lactate from your muscles. You\u0027ll finish each effort off with a big surge based on your Anaerobic Capacity (AC). In just 30 minutes, you\u0027ll be doing efforts targeting your sprint power, FTP, and AC for an exceptionally well-rounded workout.\n\n\u200B\n\nSupport the Wahooligan Tour by [donating to the Davis Phinney Foundation](https://secure2.convio.net/dpf/site/TR?pg=pfind\u0026fr_id=1391) and their programs to help people living with Parkinsons.\n",

It trains your ability to generate force through the pedals by ensuring you recruit ALL of your muscles to get those cranks turning. No matter your preferred discipline, these efforts are key to teaching your body to recruit all of the muscle fibers in your legs.\n\n\u200B\n\nAll of the benefits in this session come from hitting these 20-second efforts as hard as you possibly can. To do that, you need full recovery between each sprint, and you need to respect that recovery. These efforts should see you start at super low RPMs with very high torque. As you start and increase the effort, your cadence will naturally increase. **Your goal is to get your cadence as high as possible by the end of each 20-second effort.** To maximize your muscle recruitment, you want to both push down and pull up on the pedals at the start. Proper core engagement is a must - your legs need a good strong backboard to push against.\n\n\u200B\n\nWe understand that not everyone\u0027s trainer has the necessary resistance or the required stability to perform this workout as described. If you can\u0027t safely stand up, then you can get much of the same benefit by doing these efforts seated. If your trainer can\u2019t handle the rapid change in speed or does not have high enough resistance at a super low cadence, then you can start the efforts at a higher cadence and treat them as \u201Cnormal\u201D all-out sprints.\n",

              "description": "The goal of this workout is to help develop your baseline aerobic fitness. While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are just times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right!\n\n\u200B\n\nMost people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022 Truth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted. So what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like?\n\nFor 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70% is ok, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm and your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster. You will have to trust us on that one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions! Or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 11\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 1\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

After a big year of success in Season 3 at the Leadville Trail 100, Season 4 sees a new group of riders reaching for gravel bikes as the race of focus becomes SBT GRVL in Steamboat Springs, CO. In the first of five episodes, the riders meet in Memphis, TN at Victory Bicycle Studio, a local business that is helping the riders find the best bike for them to find success! Follow along and get ready to binge the entire season right now!\n\n\u200B\n\n**Episode 2: Age Is Just A Number**\n\nIn episode 2 we arrive in Bentonville for arguably the MOST important stop on our journey to SBT GRVL, skills. After receiving their bikes in Memphis, TN - Victory Bicycle Studio got them all ready and shipped them to Arkansas to be reunited. In this episode we hear from Rich about why he chose to take on something as daunting as FTGU as well as learn valuable skills with The Ride Series team and 15 of our closest FTGU friends.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Episode 3: Redefining Limits**\n\nIn episode 3 we see our team begin to understand what it will take to finish SBT GRVL. We visit Gunnison, CO for a riding camp to push the limits 6 weeks out from race day. Our goal is to ride the distance and ascent of the race over two days at altitude and see what people struggle with. We also check in with Lou and his path to FTGU. Lou has big goals and finding balance in life and sport is key!\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: This is a great way to watch a compelling documentary while developing your baseline aerobic fitness. The intensity of this workout will vary mostly between 60-70% of FTP, with heart rate remaining entirely in zone 2.

What is often missed in this project is that we truly believe in building a team, a family and more, that it would be even tougher to do alone. Sit down on your couch with some popcorn and a blanket, but don\u0027t forget to bring your friends - this one is full of moments that will make you want to get off the couch!\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: the workout accompanying this film varies from endurance to tempo to sub-threshold. The higher intensity efforts aren\u0027t the hardest you\u0027ll experience so that you can keep your attention on the film, however, they are just hard enough to help improve your FTP, oxygen utilization efficiency, and the ability to recover quickly between hard efforts. The workout intensity reflects the intensity of the riders in many places, so you may feel as if you\u0027re climbing Mont Ventoux or that you\u0027re a part of a sprint lead-out train on the run into the finish line.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s how to turn off on-screen graphics for the best viewing experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterInspiration)\n",

              "description": "The training benefit of this session comes down to the uncomfortably high cadence you need to hold during each effort. Even though these efforts are under FTP, the high leg speed required will leave your system working harder than usual for the required power output.\n\n\nBy maintaining the highest cadence possible (without bouncing in the saddle) you end up pushing your neuromuscular coordination near its limits in a similar way to Cadence Builds.\n\n\u200B\n\nWith an emphasis on low torque (high RPM) efforts, this session is the polar opposite to sessions like GOAT and Power Station. Even though these efforts are short and below FTP the high cadence places more of a load on your cardiovascular system, so expect your heart rate and breathing to be higher than normal for the power.\n\n\u200B\n\nSince muscles can only contract (pull) any given muscle will primarily move a joint in a single direction. When it comes to pedaling a bike, your quads and glutes can push the pedals down, while your hamstrings and hip flexors pull the pedals back up (with the help of your glutes and quads on the other leg). If you were to pedal with one leg (as you do in Cadence Drills) and your hamstrings and glutes were unable to contract, once you get to the bottom of the pedal stroke your leg would be stuck down there. No matter how hard you might try, your glutes and quads will do nothing to help you get that pedal all the way around. Suppose you do have both feet clipped in, and you are letting your opposite leg push down to bring your leg back up to 12 o\u0027clock. If your quads and glutes are still contracting (pushing the pedal down) while the glutes and quads of your other leg are starting to push their pedal down, you will end up with one leg working against the other. You must relax the glutes and quads of one leg to get all of the power out of the glutes and quads of your other leg.\n\nThis is where neuromuscular coordination comes into play. During each pedal revolution, your legs have to \u201Cswitch on\u201D and \u201Cswitch off\u201D almost all of the muscles in your legs. By maintaining your highest cadence without bouncing, you are pushing all of the muscles in each leg to contract and relax (switch on and off) as quickly as possible.\n\n\nWhile we give specific cadence targets in this session, everyone has a different limit to what cadence they can maintain before bouncing in the saddle. To get the intended benefit of this session you need to maintain the power targets at the highest cadence that YOU can maintain. For some that might be 105RPM, for others, it might be 150RPM. What matters is that you push YOUR neuromuscular system to its limits.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-Up **\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: N/A\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 5\n\n**Interval **\n\nEffort: 5 minutes @ RPE 6 -- 80% of FTP -- 100\u002B RPM -- HR \u003C95%\n\nRecovery: 8 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume **\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down **\n\n18 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- \u003C45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

This session is designed to sharpen muscle activation and improve recovery after intense efforts.\n\nFinish strong, and I\u2019ll see you in Burgberg!\n\n\u200B\n\nWith short near-maximal sprint efforts like these, you\u2019ll recruit all of the muscle fibers in your legs. While cadence builds force your muscles to contract and relax as quickly as possible, this session forces your muscles to contract with maximal power. Just like cadence builds, this session becomes one of the best ways to train your neuromuscular system.\n\nEven if your target event does not require you to complete maximal sprints, there is a substantial trickle-down efficiency effect to the longer-duration power efforts when you train your neuromuscular system.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/9866624296)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

This workout features 3 sets of intervals. Each set combines a series of 40-second efforts with 20-second recoveries, followed by an immediate transition to a sustained effort just below threshold. These short efforts with minimal recovery deplete your anaerobic gas tank, forcing your body to get better at producing power aerobically. This combination will help improve your Anaerobic Capacity, (AC) your Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP), and your Functional Threshold Power (FTP), all in just under an hour.\n\n\u200B\n\nAt the start of each set, your body starts to dip into your anaerobic reserves to help hit the high-power targets. Your body then starts to ramp up your oxygen intake in order to produce more of the power requirements aerobically. With such short recovery time between these efforts, your AC is steadily drained through each set. By the time the last short interval arrives, your body will be forced to produce almost all of that power aerobically, which will push your lungs to their very limit.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis is the optimal time to stress your body\u2019s ability to produce power at threshold. With your AC depleted (and your lungs and heart working near maximal capacity), the shorter sustained efforts that would normally be a piece of cake will have a bit more...sting. No matter what your preferred discipline, terrain, or distance, this session will make you fitter and faster.\n\n\u200B\n\nFeaturing exciting, on-bike camera footage from the Velon Hammer Series, _The Chores_ will make you earn your keep.\n",

But since few of us can put down pro-level watts, we made it so all of the efforts are scaled to your own personal 4DP\u00AE profile. That means you get to experience exactly what the pros experience relative to your own abilities. When they sprint, you sprint. When they attack, you attack.

The first pyramid will begin to fatigue your muscles and tax your AC before you face 20 minutes at tempo. With both of those efforts under your belt, the second pyramid will drain the rest of your AC and ask your aerobic system to pick up the slack. This might even feel similar to a mountain bike or cyclocross race effort- you take it out hard, jockeying for the hole shot or a front pack position before getting into the technical elements. Then you settle into a sustainable effort for a short while, maybe working with a couple others before battling it out for your final finishing position.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n9 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4 -- 70% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n**Build x3**\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n1 minute 30 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of sets: 2\n\nRest between sets: 20 minutes @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR \u003C100\n\nInterval repeats per set: 1\n\n**Interval **\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 200% of FTP -- \u003E105%\n\n50 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 9.5 -- 180% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n40 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 150% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n40 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n50 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n50 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n40 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 150% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 9.5 -- 180% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n40 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 200% of FTP -- \u003E105%\n\n7 minutes 30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume **\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down **\n\n10 minutes 40 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n",

              "description": "Just like Fight Club and Who Dares, this session is all about surging well above threshold, and then trying to recover without dropping your power anywhere close to your recovery zone. The 2 things that make this session stand out are:\n\n1. You only have one single continuous effort (which happens to be 60-minutes in length)\n2. Your recovery power is low Tempo, which is good because any higher than that and you wouldn\u0027t last the full 60 minutes!\n\nAs you increase intensity from 80% of FTP up to 100% of FTP, your legs begin to produce more and more metabolites, but the rate at which your body CAN clear them is almost the same. As you close in on 100% of FTP you suddenly are at a point where production of metabolites equals your clearance rate. Now move just a bit over FTP and those metabolites are going to continue to build until you drop your effort back below FTP.\n\n\nTo improve your bodies clearance rate for those metabolites, you need to spend a decent amount of time with more of those metabolites in your system than your bodies current clearance rate can handle.\n\n\nThat is what this session is all about, short hard efforts above FTP to build an excess of metabolites, followed by steady riding at 80% of FTP. This steady-state effort between surges is high enough that your body will still be working at max clearance rates but low enough that you can keep doing those surges over and over again, which is good for you because this is not a short interval.\n\n\nWhile you can achieve the same training stimuli by holding shorter blocks above FTP, those sessions have their drawbacks. The main one is nailing the exact right intensity above FTP that will allow you to accumulate enough time in that metabolite flooded state. While we like to think our FTP is set in stone, the reality is it can fluctuate from day to day, which makes finding that balancing point for a session like that so difficult. You can easily go too hard and blow up early, or not go hard enough and never really push that clearance rate to the max. By hitting surges well above FTP, then holding an effort a good deal below FTP, any day to day variation in your FTP becomes less of an issue because you never have to dance 5W above or below it.\n\n\nThe added benefit to this Surge and Settle workout style is the boost it can give to your Anaerobic Capacity. An improved AC means you can recover faster, not just from sprint type efforts, but from repeated MAP and FTP efforts as well.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up **\n\n40 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 8 -- 105% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of Sets: 12\n\nRest between sets: 4 minutes 40 seconds @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR \u003C100\n\nInterval repeats per: NA\n\n**Interval **\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume **\n\n1 hour 35 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down **\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR \u003C70%\n",

The first two drills, Cadence Holds and Builds, are designed to improve the way you recruit your leg, glute and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke. They do this by forcing you to sustain a cadence just above \u0027comfortable\u0027 and by pushing you to your maximal cadence.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe last drill, Single Leg Efforts, ask you to unclip one leg and ride at a steady, single-legged effort. This forces you to pull up on the pedal instead of just pushing down and ensures maximal muscle awareness and engagement. This workout is best done while riding indoors on a trainer because even small variations in terrain can affect your ability to properly execute this workout. The majority of this workout is done in heart rate Z1/2 /// 50-75% of threshold /// RPE 2-5.

              "description": "_Standing Starts_ closely simulates a lifting session on the bike because it requires the engagement of your core, upper body, and lower body. It trains your ability to generate force through the pedals by ensuring you recruit ALL of your muscles to get those cranks turning. No matter your preferred discipline, these efforts are key to teaching your body to recruit all of the muscle fibers in your legs.\n\n\u200B\n\nAll of the benefits in this session come from hitting these 20-second efforts as hard as you possibly can. To do that, you need full recovery between each sprint, and you need to respect that recovery. These efforts should see you start at super low RPMs with very high torque. As you start and increase the effort, your cadence will naturally increase. **Your goal is to get your cadence as high as possible by the end of each 20-second effort.** To maximize your muscle recruitment, you want to both push down and pull up on the pedals at the start. Proper core engagement is a must - your legs need a good strong backboard to push against.\n\n\u200B\n\nWe understand that not everyone\u0027s trainer has the necessary resistance or the required stability to perform this workout as described. If you can\u0027t safely stand up, then you can get much of the same benefit by doing these efforts seated. If your trainer can\u2019t handle the rapid change in speed or does not have high enough resistance at a super low cadence, then you can start the efforts at a higher cadence and treat them as \u201Cnormal\u201D all-out sprints.\n",

              "description": "This brutal but straightforward workout is perfect for developing both FTP and MAP while teaching you a Negative Split pacing strategy. For this workout, you will complete a series of 6-minute efforts. The first 4-minutes are right at your FTP, which isn\u0027t so tough in itself, but the final 2-minutes of each effort are set above 90% of MAP.\n\n\u200B\n\nWhen we talk about a \u0022negative split\u0022 we mean completing the second half of an effort at a higher speed/power than the first half. By the time you hit the MAP portion of each interval, your heart rate and breathing rate will already be nice and high. This limits the AC demand of a standalone MAP effort, where you have a large lag time between producing the power requirement, and your body delivering the oxygen needed to hold that power. Usually, that lag time between oxygen demand and oxygen supply is covered by your AC. Paced correctly, your heart rate should essentially be increasing for the entire 6-minutes, as it will be settling into LTHR right as you up the power output.\n\n\u200B\n\nAs you complete each effort, holding 100% of FTP will feel harder and harder. This in itself is excellent mental practice for \u0022feeling\u0022 how your RPE for the same power can drift up as fatigue sets in. Knowing what 100% of FTP feels like when your legs are nearly spent is a great reminder of why starting an effort too hard will bite you in the end.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis workout ends up delivering a fantastic aerobic workload as you complete 12-minutes of MAP work with minimal help from your AC. Making this an excellent session for those who have a strong AC, but weak MAP. You also rack up 24-minutes at 100% of FTP, which by itself would be a good training load. Add in these MAP efforts, and you multiply the training impact of those 24-minutes.\n\n\u200B\n\nRegardless of your chosen discipline or event, this is a session that will benefit everyone, both regarding learning good pacing and giving your aerobic system a big training boost.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR \u003C100\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort** x2\n\nNumber of sets:\n\nRest between sets: 30 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nInterval repeats per set: 3\n\n**Interval**\n\nEffort 1: 4 minutes @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\nEffort 2: 2 minutes @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\nRest: 5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n50 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minute @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR \u003C70%\n",

While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are just times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right!\n\n\u200B\n\nMost people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022 Truth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted. So what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like?\n\nFor 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70% is ok, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm and your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster. You will have to trust us on that one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions! Or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\nWarm-Up\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\nMain Effort\n\nNumber of Sets\n\n8.5\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set\n\n1\n\nInterval: 10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n\u200B\n\nExtra Volume\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\nCool Down\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

              "description": "Meandering along the scenic River Iller, it\u2019s time to break out your gravel bike for a classic cadence build and hold session. We\u2019ll kick off with 5 x 30-second cadence builds, allowing for 2 minutes of recovery between each, before moving on to 5 x 60-second cadence holds, again with 2 minutes recovery.\n\nWhile this session may be short, it\u2019s a key part of your weekly plan, designed to keep you efficient and in top form, even when the cadence ramps up. Stay smooth and steady\u2014and remember, \u201Cno bobbing!\u201D\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Builds:** The name of the game here is absolute peak cadence, not peak power. To achieve this, you need to be in a small gear and have very light resistance. Starting at 90-RPM, steadily increase your cadence until you reach your absolute max with about 5-seconds left, and hold that to the end. Your limiting factor on these efforts needs to be leg speed. If resistance/power output is your limiting factor, try starting in an easier gear, or shift into an easier gear 15-seconds in. Bouncing in the saddle is okay for this drill.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Holds**: These efforts require you to maintain the highest cadence you can without starting to bounce in the saddle. For some of you that will be 100-RPM, for others, it will be 150-RPM. The key is to settle into YOUR peak sustainable cadence. Like the Builds, the goal here is not high power, so these efforts are limited to 90% of FTP. Do not be surprised if your heart rate is well into Zone 4 by the time you hit the last few holds.\n\n\nTo properly execute this session, your effort between drills needs to be low. With limited recovery time between these maximal Neuromuscular Efforts, riding above Zone 1 between efforts will only reduce your ability to max out your cadence. While the power targets between are Zone 1, do not be surprised if your heart rate does not drop below Zone 2 after the first couple builds.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/9885886076)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

While it\u0027s not as comprehensive or as accurate as our main fitness test, _Full Frontal_, it\u0027s far more approachable and easier to pace for new riders. It also doesn\u0027t require any special preparation. You just need to feel relatively fresh.\n\n\u200B\n\nBased on more than a year of research (and after dozens of lab tests and thousands of online tests) and using sophisticated analysis of power and heart rate data, _Half Monty_ is far more accurate and comprehensive than standard ramp tests.\n\n\u200B\n\nIt also tells you more about who you are as an athlete. _Half Monty_ provides you with your FTP, Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP), and Cycling Threshold Heart Rate (cTHR), all of which we use to personalize your workout targets.\n\n\u200B\n\nIf you\u0027re still using the 4DP estimates when you set up your account, _Half Monty_ will also refine your AC and NM estimates (but will not do so if you\u0027ve done _Full Frontal_ or manually adjusted your estimates). If you want fully accurate AC and NM, as well as your Rider Type, Strengths, Weaknesses, and training plans adjusted to those Strengths and Weaknesses, you\u0027ll need to expose yourself to the _Full Frontal_ 4DP fitness test.\n\n\u200B\n\nReady to climb the ramp? You\u0027ll need the following before you start:\n\n- A heart rate monitor if you want the most accurate results. Don\u0027t have one? Order one [HERE](https://wahoofitness.com/devices)\n- Some kind of power device connected (trainer, power meter, virtual power, etc.)\n- Be ready to pay close attention to the instructions in the workout\n- Be sure your profile is complete and up-to-date (Profile \u003E About You). Accurate information helps us make our calculations\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to \u0027[Why Fitness Testing Matters](https://the-knowledge-by-wahoo-sports-science.simplecast.com/episodes/testing-testing-1-2-3-why-fitness-testing-matters)\u0027 on The Knowledge Podcast by Wahoo Sports Science.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s some more information on how to get the most from your fitness test.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterFitnessAssessment)\n",

              "description": "The goal of this workout is to help develop your baseline aerobic fitness. While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are just times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right!\n\n\u200B\n\nMost people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022 Truth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted. So what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like?\n\nFor 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70% is ok, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm and your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster. You will have to trust us on that one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions! Or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\nWarm-Up\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\nMain Effort\n\nNumber of Sets\n\n5\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set\n\n1\n\nInterval: 10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n\u200B\n\nExtra Volume\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\nCool Down\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

The first set of sprints has enough recovery that you\u0027ll be able to work your NM to the max. The second set still has enough recovery to allow you to hit high power numbers, but the reduced time between sprints stresses your ability to recover and repeat that high effort. That means you\u0027ll start to dip into AC. The last set\u2014with equal sprint and recovery times\u2014ensures your heart rate never gets a chance to drop down. That works your MAP like nobody\u0027s business.\n",

You\u2019ll want to savor every second of those short recoveries. This workout will help improve your FTP and improve your ability to recover while pushing just under your threshold for the first half of each effort. You\u2019ll also learn to manage your pacing and put out power above your threshold after holding steady just below that breakpoint.\n\n\u200B\n\nRiders with sustained weakness will benefit greatly from this workout, as will anyone looking to push up their FTP.\n\n_Attacker_ is quite similar to the SUF workout, _Defender._ However, the efforts within each interval are 2-minutes shorter, and instead of starting harder and backing off like in _Defender,_ the efforts in this session start controlled and keep squeezing harder and harder until the end.\n",

The first two drills, Cadence Holds and Builds, are designed to improve the way you recruit your leg, glute and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke. They do this by forcing you to sustain a cadence just above \u0027comfortable\u0027 and by pushing you to your maximal cadence.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe last drill, Single Leg Efforts, ask you to unclip one leg and ride at a steady, single-legged effort. This forces you to pull up on the pedal instead of just pushing down and ensures maximal muscle awareness and engagement. This workout is best done while riding indoors on a trainer because even small variations in terrain can affect your ability to properly execute this workout. The majority of this workout is done in heart rate Z1/2 /// 50-75% of threshold /// RPE 2-5. You should keep the effort level below threshold (heart rate Z4, 100% of threshold, RPE 7-8) during the max cadence efforts.\n\n\u200B\n\nWORKOUT GOALS:\n\n- To improve stillness and stability at high cadences.\n- To improve muscle fiber engagement for improved efficiency at all cadences.\n- To increase maximum cadence.\n- To make that pedal stroke as smooth as butter.\n\nCADENCE TARGETS:\n\n- Warm-up 80-90rpm\n- Build: 90-150rpm\n- Hold: 115rpm\n- Single Leg: 85rpm\n\nListen to The Knowledge podcast, by Wahoo Sports Science - The Benefits of High Cadence Training: [https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence](https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n3 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 3\n\nRest Between Sets: 8 minutes @ RPE 23 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: N/A\n\n**Interval**\n\nCadence Build: 30 seconds @ RPE 8 -- Starting at 90RPM Build to Max RPM -- Max Power is NOT Goal\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nCadence Hold: 45 seconds @ RPE 7.5 -- \u003C100% FTP -- Highest RPM you can hold without Bouncing\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nSingle Leg: 1 minute @ RPE 6 -- Single Leg Only -- \u003C50% of FTP\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nSingle Leg: 1 minute @ RPE 6 -- Single Leg Only, Opposite Leg -- \u003C50% of FTP (100% of FTP with both legs = 50% of FTP\n\nwith one leg)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n8 minutes 15 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are just times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right!\n\n\u200B\n\nMost people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022 Truth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted. So what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like?\n\nFor 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70% is ok, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm and your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster. You will have to trust us on that one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions!

              "description": "This is a session that you\u0027ll want to complete in Level, rather than Erg, mode. The only time we would suggest Erg mode is if you are unable to maintain the lower power targets set between sprints.\n\n\u200B\n\nWith short maximal sprint efforts, you\u0027ll recruit every muscle fiber you have in your legs each effort. While cadence builds force your muscles to contract and relax as quickly as possible, this session forces your muscles to contract with maximal force. Just like cadence builds this session becomes one of the best ways to train your neuromuscular system. Even if your target event does not require you to complete maximal sprints, there is a substantial trickle-down effect to the longer duration power efforts when you train your neuromuscular system.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session is a great alternate to cadence builds or standing starts for those completing our SUF Strength sessions. On days you complete off the bike strength work you want your on bike training to complement the suffering you put yourself through off the bike. That means short maximal efforts (whether for power or for cadence) are the best workouts to complement the strength gains you\u0027ve made off the bike.\n\n\u200B\n\nAs long as you run this session in slope mode you can complete the sprints either seated or out of the saddle. For those competing in events that do not require much (if any) standing (such as Time Trials or Triathalons) you should complete this sprints seated (and in the aerobars or drops if that is where you are racing).\n\n\u200B\n\nYou should also do these efforts seated if you don\u0027t feel an out-of-the-saddle maximal sprint is stable/safe to do on your trainer. Regardless of using ERG or Slope mode, you do not want to hold anything back on any sprint. Seeing your peak power drop as the session goes on is totally normal as your legs fatigue. This is where RPE really becomes the most important metric, rather than power, heart rate, or cadence.

              "description": "You can never have too many tools in the shed. After years of lobbying, we finally convinced Grunter von Agony to share his favorite set of implements with us: the fabled _14 Vise Grips_. Taken individually, each of the 14 intervals might appear tame, incapable of inflicting a significant squeeze. But when expertly applied in the correct order, they apply just the right kind of pressure to turn a Couchlandrian into a Sufferlandrian, just like turning coal into diamonds.\n\n\u200B\n\nWhile the duration of each Vise Grip varies (from 30 seconds to 2 minutes), the power targets and recovery durations between them remain constant. The first 30-second interval should feel like a Sunday stroll in the park, but by the end of the first 2-minute Vise Grip, you\u0027ll be cursing Grunter\u0027s name. As the intervals get shorter, time will appear to stretch. That final 30-second effort will feel like an eternity. When you roll up to the second set, you\u0027ll know what you\u0027re in for, so just put your head down and prepare yourself to crush or be crushed.\n\n\u200B\n\nOnce you make it through all 14 Vise Grips, you will have been north of your Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) for a total of 16 minutes. Changing the duration of the efforts (while keeping the same recovery) stresses your Anaerobic Capacity (AC) in a more dynamic way than, say, a more straightforward on/off session like _Half is Easy_. Since the longer efforts have the same recovery duration as the shorter ones, you will eventually deplete your AC, forcing your body to rely on your MAP to hit the required power targets. As the intervals get shorter in the second half of each set, you\u0027ll find that you have just enough left in the tank to complete the next effort.\n\n\u200B\n\nUltimately this workout combines the advantages of shorter, higher-power intervals with longer recovery (great for building muscular strength) with the advantages of longer, higher-power intervals with inadequate recovery (great for driving up your MAP and improving your AC).\n",

Instead, it\u0027s intended to be used as you begin tapering for an event or test day. While the 3-minute MAP efforts are by no means easy, there are only 3 efforts, with nice long 7-minute recoveries between them. What that means is you will be close to fully recovered at the start of each MAP effort.\n\nUnless you have a substantial VO2 weakness, this session won\u0027t do much to help improve your MAP. It will, however, help you maintain your current level. There is just enough sting in this workout to get your system working near its max, but not enough time near your max to add much fatigue. Regardless of what event you are targeting (with the exception of a flying 200m or Kilo on the track) this should be one of your go-to sessions in the final 10 days of your preparation since it primes your cardiovascular system to help you produce power with oxygen more effectively.\n\n\u200B\n\nWhile ERG mode is great for many workouts, this is one that you might want to run in Level mode, especially if your training has been going well or your Full Frontal results are more than 2 months old. The benefit of this session comes from your body just about hitting its max for the final 10-30 seconds of each effort. Follow the targets set for the first 3-minute interval, and then make any necessary changes to the intensity for the final two.\n\n\u200B\n\nEven though there are cadence targets for each section, you should aim for the same cadence you would hold during the 5-minute test in Full Frontal. The goal is to strike a balance between your cardiovascular system and your muscular system. If your cadence is too low, you will be putting too much stress on your muscular system. Too high and you will be pushing your cardiovascular system more than necessary. If you are relatively fresh, this is how you should feel by the end of each effort:\n\n1. Your heart rate should be above your LTHR.\n2. Your breathing rate should be near its max.\n3. Your legs should be hurting.\n\nThat said, you shouldn\u0027t feel like you are turning yourself inside out to make it through the final 30 seconds.

Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right!\n\n\u200B\n\nMost people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022 Truth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted. So what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like?\n\nFor 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70% is ok, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm and your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster.

We\u2019ll kick off with 5 x 30-second cadence builds, allowing for 2 minutes of recovery between each, before moving on to 5 x 60-second cadence holds, again with 2 minutes recovery.\n\nWhile this session may be short, it\u2019s a key part of your weekly plan, designed to keep you efficient and in top form, even when the cadence ramps up. Stay smooth and steady\u2014and remember, \u201Cno bobbing!\u201D\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Builds:** The name of the game here is absolute peak cadence, not peak power. To achieve this, you need to be in a small gear and have very light resistance. Starting at 90-RPM, steadily increase your cadence until you reach your absolute max with about 5-seconds left, and hold that to the end. Your limiting factor on these efforts needs to be leg speed. If resistance/power output is your limiting factor, try starting in an easier gear, or shift into an easier gear 15-seconds in. Bouncing in the saddle is okay for this drill.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Holds**: These efforts require you to maintain the highest cadence you can without starting to bounce in the saddle. For some of you that will be 100-RPM, for others, it will be 150-RPM. The key is to settle into YOUR peak sustainable cadence. Like the Builds, the goal here is not high power, so these efforts are limited to 90% of FTP. Do not be surprised if your heart rate is well into Zone 4 by the time you hit the last few holds.\n\n\nTo properly execute this session, your effort between drills needs to be low. With limited recovery time between these maximal Neuromuscular Efforts, riding above Zone 1 between efforts will only reduce your ability to max out your cadence. While the power targets between are Zone 1, do not be surprised if your heart rate does not drop below Zone 2 after the first couple builds.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/9885886076)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

The term \u0022Taper\u0022 refers to how you train in the week or so before your target event to ensure you deliver your best performance. Generally, tapering means reducing your total training volume but continuing to hit some high-intensity efforts. While there are individual variations in the best way to taper, this session has been used by countless professionals leading into the biggest races of their lives -- athletes like World Champions Rohan Dennis and Flora Duffy.\n\n\u200B\n\nWith 3 sets of micro-intervals (40/20s, 30/30s, and 20/40s) you will hit your system with just enough intensity to keep your legs sharp and responsive, without adding any real fatigue. Outside of those 3 sets of micro-intervals, this session is purposefully short and easy. This is a preparation session, not a training session! After all, your event is just around the corner and all of the important training is behind you. Riding harder or longer today will do absolutely nothing to increase your fitness by event day; in fact, all that would do is increase your fatigue, which will only hurt your performance. Rather, this session makes sure your body is humming along and ready to perform on the big day.\n",

A small country in the Balkan Peninsula that hides some of the most beautiful natural wonders and unique cultural heritage in this part of the world. Yet it remains unknown to many. Only the alternative, curious and brave plan their journeys in this hidden gem. However, a small self-organized crew from Serbia and Germany set a mission to discover and reveal those stunning natural creations of Serbia. On a bicycle. In just five days, they traversed 450 kilometers across six mountains of Western Serbia, and climbed around 11,000 meters to film and produce what you are about to experience.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: The workout accompanying this film is a recovery session. It\u0027s a very low-intensity ride, with your power remaining at or below 50% of FTP (an RPE less than 2.5 on a scale from 1 to 10) and your heart rate in Zone 1. The intensity and cadence targets will vary throughout this session to keep it interesting, but not so much that it distracts you from the story.\n",

Since feet are often neglected and subjected to high demands from activities like running or cycling, practicing this sequence at least once a week helps to rebalance and address this issue.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe objectives are to improve mobility in the feet and ankles, stretch the calves and hamstrings, and open up the hips.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Poses in this session:**\n\n- Easy Seat\n- Box Breathing\n- Foot Massage\n- Downward Dog\n- Screaming Toe\n- Yoga Squat\n- Ankle Stretch\n- Ankle Mobilisations\n- Windscreen Wipers\n",
