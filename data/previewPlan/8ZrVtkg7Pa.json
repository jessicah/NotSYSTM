      "description": "#### Special Focus: Lower Body Level 5\n\nThis six week plan is specifically designed to boost your lower body mobility, strength and power. These short sessions will target your calves, glutes, hamstrings and quads to help you produce higher cadences at a given resistance as well as improve range of motion in your ankles, hips and low back.\n\n\u200B\n\nWe recommend that you only select Level 5 if you have recently completed Special Focus Lower Body Level 4. As with any of the SYSTM strength plans, take your time with each session and follow the proper progression.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis plan may be applied in conjunction with other Special Focused strength plans, such as Upper Body or Core Focus. However, If you choose to apply concurrent plans we suggest that you do so during the off-season or at a time when your endurance training volume is low. We do not recommend adding Lower Body Focus if you are already on a training plan that includes a strength add-on.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe Special Focus stand alone plans follow a 2:1 progression and have three sessions per week on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.\n\n\u200B\n\nLet\u0027s crush this!\n",

This session is all about compound movements. In a single exercise, you will be activating both your lower and upper body and challenging your strength and stability. Be ready to concentrate on balance in one interval and then propel yourself off the ground in another. The constant change of focus is similar to a race scenario where you must be ready for various external variables. Go for it!\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?
