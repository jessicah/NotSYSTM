Today\u0027s session is a low intensity workout that challenges you with a series of drills designed to reinforce proper technique that will make you a more efficient, powerful and faster swimmer.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n200m stroke of your choice @ RPE 2 -- Z1\n\n\u200B\n\n**Activation 1**\n\nNumber of Sets: 4\n\nInterval Distance: 25m Drill of choice\n\nThe goal of a Drill set is not to swim at any given pace, but instead focus on proper form. Choose a drill or focus on one of these key points for each 25m interval:\n\n- \\*Body position- swim on horizontal plane\n- \\*Enter in front of shoulder- preventing cross over\n- \\*Breathe early- prevent wide stroke- elbow is always widest point\n- \\*Elbow is always the highest point of the stroke\n- \\*Back of hand always faces direction of travel\n- \\*Fingers to point at the bottom of pool\n- \\*Initiate your stroke from the hips\n\nRecovery: 10 seconds rest\n\n\u200B\n\n**Activation 2**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nInterval Distance:\n\n200m Pull @ RPE 3-4 -- Z2\n\n- This set eliminates the use of your legs. It requires a buoy that you can swim with between your legs. The buoy will keep your body in the correct orientation. By removing your legs from the drill you will be required to only use your arms. This will help you focus on efficient form and making the most of each stroke!\n\nRecovery: 20 seconds rest\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nThe following should all be done at a moderate pace (RPE 2-4 -- Z1-Z2), with enough rest between that you can focus on proper form\n\nInterval 1: 150m of One Arm Freestyle drill\n\n- This is an old standby. Put your non-pulling arm out in front of your body and swim with only the opposite arm. Take some time to watch the arm that is pulling. Feel your elbow directly above your hand and that you are pulling right down the midline of your body. Split your body in half with your fingertips. Your emphasis should be on power and efficiency not on speed.\n- See how few strokes you can take to get down the pool.\n- Once you have it mastered, you can leave the non-pulling arm at your side.\n\nRecovery: 20-sec rest\n\nInterval 2: 200m of 3/4 Catch Up drill\n\n- A variation to catch-up that takes us closer to the full stroke. Another way to describe this is almost catch-up. Take a stroke with the right hand, wait until this hand is almost all the way through recovery and then start your pull with the left. This creates a very rhythmic feel, almost like skating through the water. Take your pull and ride the glide from it. When you lose speed, take your next pull. Want a good example of this? Watch Olympic replays of the Aussies, particularly Ian Thorpe. He races like this drill. Efficiency is your goal.\n\nRecovery: 20-sec rest\n\nInterval 3: 200m of Elbow-Hip-Elbow drill\n\n- A variation on side glide kick. The same goals apply balance, body roll, and head position during breathing. Start on either side with one arm extended out front, and the other at your side. With the fingers of the hand at your side, touch the elbow of your upper arm, then your hip, and then the elbow again. Now take your stroke or three strokes. Kick and glide and repeat.\n\nRecovery: 20-sec rest\n\nInterval 4: 150m of Fist Drill\n\n- Swim freestyle with your hands in fists. This is going to force you to get your forearms involved in the stroke because they have more surface area than your hands. Keep your elbow high under the water. Your forearm, from elbow to fingertips should be perpendicular to the bottom of the pool. Again, watch Ian Thorpe. You will feel like you are slipping through the water which is normal, however, the more water you feel like you are pulling the more efficient you are getting.\n\nRecovery: 20-sec rest\n\nInterval 5: 200m of Zipper Drill\n\n- This drill is done by pulling the fingers up the side of the body until they come into the armpit. The point of this is to keep a nice high elbow on recovery and to force the body to roll. Many use the Fingertip drag drill to accomplish this but we prefer this drill because the body roll essentially gives this drill a dual purpose.\n\nRecovery: 20-sec rest\n\nRepeat until full swim time is completed\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n200m stroke of your choice @ RPE \u003C 2 -- Z1\n\n\u200B\n\n**Total Distance**\n\n1600m\n",

The goal of this ride will be to work on your good form with a slightly higher cadence than normal, keeping the legs supple and spinning. We\u2019ll gently build the effort up a 3km climb to get the heart, legs and lungs working a little harder before descending to our final destination at Chira Lake. This workout is perfect for those days when you need an easier session or want to activate the body before going deeper.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis workout focusses on a progressive build through the duration of the climb helping with your pacing skills and sustained efforts.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/8773915186)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty. As founder of The Col Collective, Mike has made a career out of riding, filming, and telling the story of epic rides and mountains across the continent. As your On Location co-creator and host, Mike\u0027s engaging character, curious mind, and friendly nature will have you cueing up your next ride with him before you\u0027ve even finished the cool-down._\n",

To account for this, we have limited the recovery duration to be equal to the interval duration.

              "description": "Meandering along the scenic River Iller, it\u2019s time to break out your gravel bike for a classic cadence build and hold session. We\u2019ll kick off with 5 x 30-second cadence builds, allowing for 2 minutes of recovery between each, before moving on to 5 x 60-second cadence holds, again with 2 minutes recovery.\n\nWhile this session may be short, it\u2019s a key part of your weekly plan, designed to keep you efficient and in top form, even when the cadence ramps up. Stay smooth and steady\u2014and remember, \u201Cno bobbing!\u201D\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Builds:** The name of the game here is absolute peak cadence, not peak power. To achieve this, you need to be in a small gear and have very light resistance. Starting at 90-RPM, steadily increase your cadence until you reach your absolute max with about 5-seconds left, and hold that to the end. Your limiting factor on these efforts needs to be leg speed. If resistance/power output is your limiting factor, try starting in an easier gear, or shift into an easier gear 15-seconds in. Bouncing in the saddle is okay for this drill.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Holds**: These efforts require you to maintain the highest cadence you can without starting to bounce in the saddle. For some of you that will be 100-RPM, for others, it will be 150-RPM. The key is to settle into YOUR peak sustainable cadence. Like the Builds, the goal here is not high power, so these efforts are limited to 90% of FTP. Do not be surprised if your heart rate is well into Zone 4 by the time you hit the last few holds.\n\n\nTo properly execute this session, your effort between drills needs to be low. With limited recovery time between these maximal Neuromuscular Efforts, riding above Zone 1 between efforts will only reduce your ability to max out your cadence. While the power targets between are Zone 1, do not be surprised if your heart rate does not drop below Zone 2 after the first couple builds.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/9885886076)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty. As founder of The Col Collective, Mike has made a career out of riding, filming, and telling the story of epic rides and mountains across the continent. As your On Location co-creator and host, Mike\u0027s engaging character, curious mind, and friendly nature will have you cueing up your next ride with him before you\u0027ve even finished the cool-down._\n",

              "description": "This brutal but straightforward workout is perfect for developing both FTP and MAP while teaching you a Negative Split pacing strategy. For this workout, you will complete a series of 4-minute efforts. The first 3-minutes are right at your FTP, which isn\u0027t so tough in itself, but the final 1-minute of each effort are set above 90% of MAP.\n\n\u200B\n\nWhen we talk about a \u0022negative split\u0022 we mean completing the second half of an effort at a higher speed/power than the first half. By the time you hit the MAP portion of each interval, your heart rate and breathing rate will already be nice and high. This limits the AC demand of a standalone MAP effort, where you have a large lag time between producing the power requirement, and your body delivering the oxygen needed to hold that power. Usually, that lag time between oxygen demand and oxygen supply is covered by your AC. Paced correctly, your heart rate should essentially be increasing for the entire 4-minutes, as it will be settling into LTHR right as you up the power output.\n\n\u200B\n\nAs you complete each effort, holding 100% of FTP will feel harder and harder. This in itself is excellent mental practice for \u0022feeling\u0022 how your RPE for the same power can drift up as fatigue sets in. Knowing what 100% of FTP feels like when your legs are nearly spent is a great reminder of why starting an effort too hard will bite you in the end.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis workout ends up delivering a fantastic aerobic workload as you complete 8-minutes of MAP work with minimal help from your AC, making this an excellent session for those who have a strong AC but weak MAP. You also rack up 24-minutes at 100% of FTP, which by itself would be a good training load. Add in these MAP efforts, and you multiply the training impact of those 24-minutes.\n\n\u200B\n\nRegardless of your chosen discipline or event, this is a session that will benefit everyone, both regarding learning good pacing and giving your aerobic system a big training boost.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C85%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C95%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 90% of MAP (105-135% of FTP)\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 2\n\nRest Between Sets: 15 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 4\n\n**Interval**\n\nFTP Effort: 3 minutes @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\nVO2 Effort: 1 minute @ RPE 9 -- 90-95% of MAP (105-130% of FTP) \n\nRecovery: 5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70% \n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n4 minutes @ RPE 1 -- \u003C45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

A small country in the Balkan Peninsula that hides some of the most beautiful natural wonders and unique cultural heritage in this part of the world. Yet it remains unknown to many. Only the alternative, curious and brave plan their journeys in this hidden gem. However, a small self-organized crew from Serbia and Germany set a mission to discover and reveal those stunning natural creations of Serbia. On a bicycle. In just five days, they traversed 450 kilometers across six mountains of Western Serbia, and climbed around 11,000 meters to film and produce what you are about to experience.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: The workout accompanying this film is a recovery session.

              "description": "Good swimming technique is the key to efficient swimming. Today\u0027s session is a low intensity workout that challenges you with a series of drills designed to reinforce proper technique that will make you a more efficient, powerful and faster swimmer.\n\n\u200B\n\nIn case you need to brush up on your other swimming [technique definitions or drills](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterSwimDrills).\n\nFor help understanding your swim workout and calculating your pace zones, please see [this article](https://wahoosystm.com/SwimSessionFAQ).\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n200m stroke of your choice @ RPE 2 -- Z1\n\n\u200B\n\n**Activation 1**\n\nNumber of Sets: 4\n\nInterval Distance: 25m Drill of your choice\n\nThe goal of a Drill set is not to swim at any given pace, but instead focus on proper form. Choose a drill or focus on one of these key points for each 25m interval:\n\n- Body position- swim on horizontal plane\n- Enter in front of shoulder- preventing cross over\n- Breathe early- prevent wide stroke- elbow is always widest point\n- Elbow is always the highest point of the stroke\n- Back of hand always faces direction of travel\n- Fingers to point at the bottom of pool\n- Initiate your stroke from the hips\n\nRecovery: 10 sec rest\n\n**Activation 2**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nInterval Distance: 200m Kick @ RPE 5 -- Z3\n\n- This drill requires you to only use your legs for propulsion. Face the sky with your arms extended above your head, biceps squeezing your ears. Kick from the hips with straight legs, toes just breaking the surface of the water. When you see the flags above your head, flip onto your belly so you don\u0027t hit the wall. Make note if there are no flags at your pool before doing this drill so you can look for another sign that the wall is near.\n\nRecovery: 20-sec rest\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nThe following should all be done at a moderate pace (RPE 2-4 -- Z1-Z2), with enough rest between that you can focus on proper form\n\nInterval 1: 100m of Super Slow Drill\n\n- This should be done for 25m at a time. Slow down your stroke rate as much as possible. In fact, the point here is to see how slowly you can go without sinking. Work hard to swim with perfect form concentrating not on how much water you are pulling but rather what position your hands, body, and feet are in. This drill will help you keep your balance in the water. If you can balance going slow, you can balance going fast.\n\nRecovery: 20-sec rest\n\nInterval 2: 100m swim, incorporating the Super Slow Drill\n\nInterval 3: 150m of 3-3-3 Drill\n\n- Simply put, take three strokes with your left, three with your right, and three whole strokes (6 arm pulls). This is good for a couple of things: First, continue to work on the efficiency of the one-arm strokes. Secondly, When you switch sides, you want to work on the transfer of power from right to left. Then when you take full strokes, you can quickly get into long, efficient strokes.\n\nRecovery: 20-sec rest\n\nInterval 3: 200m of Catch Up Drill\n\n- Another old standby. Swim freestyle one arm at a time. Take a stroke with the right and touch your left arm that is out in front of the body. Then take your pull with the left hand. Be sure that you are not rushing. Get as much out of each arm stroke that you can. Remember, freestyle is not of stroke of constant propulsion. It is a pull with the left and then the right. It is important that we approach it this way.\n\nRecovery: 20 sec rest\n\nInterval 4: 200m of Side-Glide-Kick Drill\n\n- Push off the wall on your side and kick for eight kicks. Keep your ear on your arm and your body straight. Make sure your knees are passing one another when you kick. After eight kicks, take a good pull with the arm on top. Use this pull to roll you to the other side and repeat the cycle. For variation do this drill with three strokes in between. I.e. on the right side with the right arm up and the left arm at your side. Take a pull with the right, left, and then right. End with your left arm up and your right arm at your side. This will help your body position in the water and if you keep your head on your arm when you are on your side it will help your head position when you breathe.\n\nRecovery: 20-sec rest\n\nInterval 5: 200m of Corkscrew Swim\n\n- This is done by alternating one stroke of freestyle and one stroke of backstroke. This repetition makes you roll over and around from front to back repeatedly, thus \u0022corkscrewing.\u201D This is useful because most of us will want to cross our bodies when we roll from our back to our stomach. Fight this and try to take perfect midline strokes over and over.\n\nRecovery: 20-sec rest\n\nInterval 6: 200m Pull\n\n- This set eliminates the use of your legs to focus on your catch and pull. Squeeze a pull buoy between your legs to keep your hips afloat and body in the correct orientation.\n- While the back of the hand always faces the direction of travel and the elbow remains the highest point of the stroke, your leading hand spears the water and the Catch phase is initiated by obtaining a grasp on the water while reaching forward. This first phase is not about producing power, rather, it sets you up for the Pull and Push Phases. Imagine pulling yourself over a barrel. Hold as much water as possible while pulling, then pushing the water back to your thigh keeping the hand on the inside on the elbow. Your stroke should accelerate as you progress through the Pull and Push Phases. There is a subtle S formation that occurs during the phases, starting with the Pull Phase just above the shoulder and continuing through the Push Phase until your hand exits the water to begin the recovery phase. Always imagine a line dividing your body lengthwise, with your left arm staying on the left side and your right arm staying on the right side. Crossover will result in additional drag and unwanted sway in the lower body.\n\nRecovery: 20-sec rest\n\nRepeat until full swim time is completed as directed by your training plan\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n200m stroke of your choice @ RPE \u003C 2 -- Z1\n\n\u200B\n\n**Total Distance**\n\n1750m\n",

              "description": "The goal of this workout is to help develop your baseline aerobic fitness. While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high and your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week. Shorter Endurance rides (like this one) can fit in both a hard week of training and a recovery week. That is, only if you do it right! Most people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022\n\n\u200B\n\nTruth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride, especially one under 90 minutes should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted.\n\nSo what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like? For 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70%, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in low to mid Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can; for most this is 80-90rpm. Also, your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster, but you will have to trust us on this one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions, or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: 4\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nNA\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

Continually undulating we\u2019ll hit each of the eight rolling climbs hard, working at low cadence with high intensity to build strength. Mike will keep you focused on good form, though, and make sure you keep the power down on all the way over each summit.\n\n\u200B\n\nIt wouldn\u0027t be an On Location ride, though, if we didn\u0027t have a look at the scenic attractions along the way, though, so get ready for craggy rocks, turquoise clear waters, and a few opportunities to delve into the Costa Brava\u2019s finest as we find out more about the region along this 21km route.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Route on Strava](https://www.strava.com/routes/2967787441439728434)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty. As founder of The Col Collective, Mike has made a career out of riding, filming, and telling the story of epic rides and mountains across the continent. As your On Location co-creator and host, Mike\u0027s engaging character, curious mind, and friendly nature will have you cueing up your next ride with him before you\u0027ve even finished the cool-down._\n",

That is not the point! If we wanted you to go harder, you would see a different workout in your Training Plan. We know you can go harder for 25-minutes, but that is not the point of a Tempo Session.\n\n\u200B\n\nWhat many people don\u0027t realize is that your body\u0027s ability to process oxygen and metabolites is nearly identical from 80%-100% of FTP. The main change across that intensity range is the rate at which those metabolites are being generated. While you would get a slightly greater training load from doing this session at higher power, you would be adding more fatigue to your system than we want. That extra fatigue means you either need to ease off your workouts in the days leading up or ease off your workouts on the days after. From a big picture point of view that\u0027s no good! This session gives a great steady-state aerobic training load while leaving you fresh enough that you can hit training hard the days before and after. That means your training load over the entire week is often higher when you maintain restraint and stick to those Tempo Targets.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-Up **\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C85%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C95%\n\n6 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: N/A\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 4\n\n**Interval**\n\nEffort: 8 minutes @ RPE 6 -- 80% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\nRecovery: 12 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume **\n\n45 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C85%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 1 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

A small country in the Balkan Peninsula that hides some of the most beautiful natural wonders and unique cultural heritage in this part of the world. Yet it remains unknown to many. Only the alternative, curious and brave plan their journeys in this hidden gem. However, a small self-organized crew from Serbia and Germany set a mission to discover and reveal those stunning natural creations of Serbia. On a bicycle. In just five days, they traversed 450 kilometers across six mountains of Western Serbia, and climbed around 11,000 meters to film and produce what you are about to experience.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: The workout accompanying this film is a recovery session. It\u0027s a very low-intensity ride, with your power remaining at or below 50% of FTP (an RPE less than 2.5 on a scale from 1 to 10) and your heart rate in Zone 1. The intensity and cadence targets will vary throughout this session to keep it interesting, but not so much that it distracts you from the story.\n",

The real purpose is to essentially keep your fatigue levels right where they are, by giving your body just enough intensity to ensure that you are not \u0022more recovered\u0022 after today.\n\n\u200B\n\nWhile some folks will say that there is no training benefit to such short Sub-Threshold efforts, when viewed in a bigger picture sense (like a 3-week training block) they can be the perfect efforts to ensure you get the most out of a longer training block.\n\n\u200B\n\nWe would even ask that you view this session as more of an assessment, rather than strictly a workout. That\u0027s because you should be comparing this power output to heart rate response and your own internal RPE. When you have heavy fatigue, your heart rate will struggle to hit its normal peaks. When fresh you would be getting into Z4 heart rate by the end of the last two intervals, and your RPE should never really climb above a 7. When holding onto excess fatigue, your heart rate won\u0027t climb above Z3, and your RPE will be above an 8. At the same time, if you have gained a significant amount of fitness, your Heart Rate will stay in Z3, and your RPE won\u0027t climb above 6. The secondary tell between improved fitness and fatigue is how quickly your heart rate drops after each effort. When fatigued, your heart rate won\u0027t drop below Z2 during the recovery.\n\n\u200B\n\nWhile it is easy to rely solely on Power, you should always refer back to RPE and Heart Rate, and today is the perfect session to practice comparing the 3.\n\n\u200B\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C85%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C95%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 90-95% of AC (130-180% of FTP)\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 4\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 4\n\n**Interval**\n\nSurge: 30 sec @ RPE 8.5 -- 90% of MAP (105-130% of FTP)\n\nSteady: 1 minutes 30 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 90% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n13 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C85%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- \u003C45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

              "description": "This is a technique-focused session designed to develop your agility, stability, range of motion, and foot speed. There is no focus on heart rate zones so you may choose to leave your monitor at home for these sessions. Between sets of each drill, you should jog/walk easily to fully recover between the efforts. While these efforts shouldn\u2019t be too taxing on you, the key is perfect form, so you want to be hitting each one rested enough that you can maintain great form for the duration. You should take a bit of extra rest between techniques, again to ensure you are rested and can nail the form. Before starting the workout, familiarize yourself with the format for high knees, butt kicks, skipping, carioca and strides. Find a flat track, field, or 50-100m of open space to perform this workout (football and soccer fields are great for this).\n\n\u200B\n\nFor help understanding your run workout and calculating your pace zones, please see [this article](https://wahoosystm.com/RunningSessionFAQ).\n\nLearn how to perform your [**Running Drills**](https://support.wahoofitness.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404080091922-Running-Drills) here.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-up:**\n\nStart off with 5-10 minutes of easy jogging/walking.\n\nHigh Knees: 2-3 sets of 50m high knees.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- Take short strides, bringing your knees up high enough that your upper legs are parallel to the ground. Focus on achieving high knees AND quick turnover, or performing as many reps as possible in a short distance.\n\n**Butt Kicks:**\n\n2-3 sets of 50m butt kicks.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- This should actually look similar to a high knee drill, but with the heels coming up to touch the bottom of your butt. Take short strides while using your hamstrings to lift your heels up beneath your butt. Your knees should come up in front of your body while pulling your heels up beneath your hips, rather than keeping your quads and knees below and in line with your hips.\n\n**Skipping:**\n\n3-4 sets of 50m skipping.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- Focus on a high knee drive and swinging your arms at your sides like you would when running.\n\n**Carioca:**\n\n4 sets of 30m Carioca in each direction (8 total).\n\nRest for 20 seconds between direction changes (at your discretion).\n\n- For this drill, you need to face sidewise to the direction you want to go. Start off moving to the right. Bring your left knee up and across your body and put your left foot in front of your right foot. Step your right foot to the right so it is parallel with your left leg again (at this point you should be positioned in the same direction and orientation that you were at the start. Next step your left leg behind your right leg, again so it lands on the right side of your right leg. Then bring your right leg back across your body, once again ending up in the starting position. Repeat this pattern for 25-30m.\n\n**Strides:**\n\n2-3 sets of 60m; Gradually build effort from RPE 3-8.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between. These are comprised of a steady acceleration over 60-80m up to 5k pace. The goal is to increase speed after each step, so you are reaching maximum speed at the end of the 60-80m stretch. You want to focus on keeping your shoulders, neck, and jaw relaxed while maintaining strong knee drive, straight and compact arm swing, planting the feet beneath the hips, and fast turnover.\n\n\u200B\n\nHigh Knees \u002B Butt Kicks:\n\nFinish these drills with one set each of 50m high knees and butt kicks.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool-down:**\n\nWalk or jog for 5 minutes to cool down.\n\nIn case you need to brush up on your running [drills](https://wahoosystm.com/RunningSessionFAQ)\n",

Today\u0027s session is a low intensity workout that challenges you with a series of drills designed to reinforce proper technique that will make you a more efficient, powerful and faster swimmer.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n200m stroke of your choice @ RPE 2 -- Z1\n\n\u200B\n\n**Activation 1**\n\nNumber of Sets: 4\n\nInterval Distance: 25m Drill of choice\n\nThe goal of a Drill set is not to swim at any given pace, but instead focus on proper form. Choose a drill or focus on one of these key points for each 25m interval:\n\n- \\*Body position- swim on horizontal plane\n- \\*Enter in front of shoulder- preventing cross over\n- \\*Breathe early- prevent wide stroke- elbow is always widest point\n- \\*Elbow is always the highest point of the stroke\n- \\*Back of hand always faces direction of travel\n- \\*Fingers to point at the bottom of pool\n- \\*Initiate your stroke from the hips\n\nRecovery: 10 seconds rest\n\n\u200B\n\n**Activation 2**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nInterval Distance:\n\n200m Pull @ RPE 3-4 -- Z2\n\n- This set eliminates the use of your legs. It requires a buoy that you can swim with between your legs. The buoy will keep your body in the correct orientation. By removing your legs from the drill you will be required to only use your arms. This will help you focus on efficient form and making the most of each stroke!\n\nRecovery: 20 seconds rest\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nThe following should all be done at a moderate pace (RPE 2-4 -- Z1-Z2), with enough rest between that you can focus on proper form\n\nInterval 1: 150m of One Arm Freestyle drill\n\n- This is an old standby. Put your non-pulling arm out in front of your body and swim with only the opposite arm. Take some time to watch the arm that is pulling. Feel your elbow directly above your hand and that you are pulling right down the midline of your body. Split your body in half with your fingertips. Your emphasis should be on power and efficiency not on speed.\n- See how few strokes you can take to get down the pool.\n- Once you have it mastered, you can leave the non-pulling arm at your side.\n\nRecovery: 20-sec rest\n\nInterval 2: 200m of 3/4 Catch Up drill\n\n- A variation to catch-up that takes us closer to the full stroke. Another way to describe this is almost catch-up. Take a stroke with the right hand, wait until this hand is almost all the way through recovery and then start your pull with the left. This creates a very rhythmic feel, almost like skating through the water. Take your pull and ride the glide from it. When you lose speed, take your next pull. Want a good example of this? Watch Olympic replays of the Aussies, particularly Ian Thorpe. He races like this drill. Efficiency is your goal.\n\nRecovery: 20-sec rest\n\nInterval 3: 200m of Elbow-Hip-Elbow drill\n\n- A variation on side glide kick. The same goals apply balance, body roll, and head position during breathing. Start on either side with one arm extended out front, and the other at your side. With the fingers of the hand at your side, touch the elbow of your upper arm, then your hip, and then the elbow again. Now take your stroke or three strokes. Kick and glide and repeat.\n\nRecovery: 20-sec rest\n\nInterval 4: 150m of Fist Drill\n\n- Swim freestyle with your hands in fists. This is going to force you to get your forearms involved in the stroke because they have more surface area than your hands. Keep your elbow high under the water. Your forearm, from elbow to fingertips should be perpendicular to the bottom of the pool. Again, watch Ian Thorpe. You will feel like you are slipping through the water which is normal, however, the more water you feel like you are pulling the more efficient you are getting.\n\nRecovery: 20-sec rest\n\nInterval 5: 200m of Zipper Drill\n\n- This drill is done by pulling the fingers up the side of the body until they come into the armpit. The point of this is to keep a nice high elbow on recovery and to force the body to roll. Many use the Fingertip drag drill to accomplish this but we prefer this drill because the body roll essentially gives this drill a dual purpose.\n\nRecovery: 20-sec rest\n\nRepeat until full swim time is completed\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n200m stroke of your choice @ RPE \u003C 2 -- Z1\n\n\u200B\n\n**Total Distance**\n\n1600m\n",

              "description": "**Half Monty: The Easy One.**\n\n\u200B\n\nWe recommend this fitness test for:\n\n- Newer riders\n- Athletes with limited experience pacing maximal efforts / fitness testing.\n- Those who are mid-plan or who just want to get a sense of where their fitness is.\n\nThe _Half Monty_ 4DP fitness test is the most accurate and complete ramp test available. While it\u0027s not as comprehensive or as accurate as our main fitness test, _Full Frontal_, it\u0027s far more approachable and easier to pace for new riders. It also doesn\u0027t require any special preparation. You just need to feel relatively fresh.\n\n\u200B\n\nBased on more than a year of research (and after dozens of lab tests and thousands of online tests) and using sophisticated analysis of power and heart rate data, _Half Monty_ is far more accurate and comprehensive than standard ramp tests.\n\n\u200B\n\nIt also tells you more about who you are as an athlete. _Half Monty_ provides you with your FTP, Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP), and Cycling Threshold Heart Rate (cTHR), all of which we use to personalize your workout targets.\n\n\u200B\n\nIf you\u0027re still using the 4DP estimates when you set up your account, _Half Monty_ will also refine your AC and NM estimates (but will not do so if you\u0027ve done _Full Frontal_ or manually adjusted your estimates). If you want fully accurate AC and NM, as well as your Rider Type, Strengths, Weaknesses, and training plans adjusted to those Strengths and Weaknesses, you\u0027ll need to expose yourself to the _Full Frontal_ 4DP fitness test.\n\n\u200B\n\nReady to climb the ramp? You\u0027ll need the following before you start:\n\n- A heart rate monitor if you want the most accurate results. Don\u0027t have one? Order one [HERE](https://wahoofitness.com/devices)\n- Some kind of power device connected (trainer, power meter, virtual power, etc.)\n- Be ready to pay close attention to the instructions in the workout\n- Be sure your profile is complete and up-to-date (Profile \u003E About You). Accurate information helps us make our calculations\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to \u0027[Why Fitness Testing Matters](https://the-knowledge-by-wahoo-sports-science.simplecast.com/episodes/testing-testing-1-2-3-why-fitness-testing-matters)\u0027 on The Knowledge Podcast by Wahoo Sports Science.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s some more information on how to get the most from your fitness test.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterFitnessAssessment)\n",

This workout will help improve your FTP and improve your ability to recover while pushing just under your threshold for the first half of each effort. You\u2019ll also learn to manage your pacing and put out power above your threshold after holding steady just below that breakpoint.\n\n\u200B\n\nRiders with sustained weakness will benefit greatly from this workout, as will anyone looking to push up their FTP.\n\n_Attacker_ is quite similar to the SUF workout, _Defender._ However, the efforts within each interval are 2-minutes shorter, and instead of starting harder and backing off like in _Defender,_ the efforts in this session start controlled and keep squeezing harder and harder until the end.\n",

In the same way that longer Tempo efforts can feel \u0022easy,\u0022 these shorter Sub-Threshold efforts can also feel \u0022easy\u0022. After all, if you can hold 100% of FTP for about an hour, then holding less than that for 5-minutes should be a piece of cake right? We know you can go harder for 5-minutes, but that is not what we are asking for.\nThis session is not intended to push you to your limits, nor is it designed to be a massive training load. The real purpose is to essentially keep your fatigue levels right where they are, by giving your body just enough intensity to ensure that you are not \u0022more recovered\u0022 after today.\nWhile some folks will say that there is no training benefit to such short Sub-Threshold efforts, when viewed in a bigger picture sense (like a 3-week training block) they can be the perfect efforts to ensure you get the most out of a longer training block.\nWe would even ask that you view this session as more of an assessment, rather than strictly a workout. That\u0027s because you should be comparing this power output to heart rate response and your own internal RPE. When you have heavy fatigue, your heart rate will struggle to hit its normal peaks. When fresh you would be getting into Z4 heart rate by the end of the last two intervals, and your RPE should never really climb above a 7. When holding onto excess fatigue, your heart rate won\u0027t climb above Z3, and your RPE will be above an 8. At the same time, if you have gained a significant amount of fitness, your Heart Rate will stay in Z3, and your RPE won\u0027t climb above 6. The secondary tell between improved fitness and fatigue is how quickly your heart rate drops after each effort. When fatigued, your heart rate won\u0027t drop below Z2 during the recovery.\nWhile it is easy to rely solely on Power, you should always refer back to RPE and Heart Rate, and today is the perfect session to practice comparing the 3.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C85%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C95%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 90-95% of AC (130-180% of FTP)\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 3\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 3\n\n**Interval**\n\nSurge: 30 sec @ RPE 8.5 -- 90% of MAP (105-130% of FTP)\n\nSteady: 2 minutes 30 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 90% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n30 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C85%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n8 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- \u003C45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

We\u2019ll be breaking this 10km climb down into three distinct sections, kicking off with a block of 6 x 50 second high tempo efforts with a 10 second burst out of the saddle before taking a swift breather before getting back on it. As we climb through the pine forest we\u2019ll switch things up a touch, alternating between low and high cadence for 30 seconds at a time for around 7 minutes. We\u2019ll then revert back to our 50 second high tempo with 10 second burst out of the saddle efforts before we build up our effort to the summit. This is going to be a challenging workout so make sure you\u2019re ready and whatever you do don\u2019t forget to take a moment to look at the views!!\n\n\u200B\n\nThis workout combines multiple different interval types that focus on improving threshold power via over-under style efforts along with low cadence work for your muscular endurance. The first and last climbs also fire up your whole energy systems with some sprints to the summit.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/8735613403)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

A small country in the Balkan Peninsula that hides some of the most beautiful natural wonders and unique cultural heritage in this part of the world. Yet it remains unknown to many. Only the alternative, curious and brave plan their journeys in this hidden gem. However, a small self-organized crew from Serbia and Germany set a mission to discover and reveal those stunning natural creations of Serbia. On a bicycle. In just five days, they traversed 450 kilometers across six mountains of Western Serbia, and climbed around 11,000 meters to film and produce what you are about to experience.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: This is a great way to watch a compelling documentary while developing your baseline aerobic fitness. The intensity of this workout will vary mostly between 60-70% of FTP, with heart rate remaining entirely in zone 2.

              "description": "Yep, there are good chunks of sub-threshold in here. But what makes this session special are the surges above threshold during each effort. Your body\u0027s ability to clear metabolites and process oxygen doesn\u0027t really change at 90% of FTP and above. What that means it that whether you are at 90% or 100% of FTP your body is clearing those things out at the same rate. It\u0027s just that at FTP your body is producing more of those metabolites that it is capable of clearing.\n\n\u200B\n\nBy surging above FTP you are creating metabolites faster than your body can clear them. If you were to settle into 100% of FTP, you would only be clearing things out at the rate you are producing them. That means whatever you have produced from that surge will just stay there. By dropping just below FTP your body is clearing things out faster than you are producing them. That means that the excess you got from that surge will slowly be cleared out.\n\n\u200B\n\nEach time a surge pops up during this workout, your body should have just about cleared what was made from the last surge. Not only does this push your body\u0027s ability to clear these things to the max, but it also teaches your mind to deal with the discomfort of burning lungs and legs associated with these efforts at or above threshold.\n\n\u200B\n\nA simpler way to think of this is that you are teaching your body and mind to \u0022recover\u0022 just below FTP. Not only does this help bump up your FTP, but it also helps you recover that much faster anytime you let off the gas, whether for a downhill, turn, or finding a good draft. Having the confidence that you can recover while feeling so uncomfortable can mean the difference between hanging onto to a new personal best and completely throwing in the towel.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis is the perfect session to practice your positive thinking from the Mental Toughness Program (If you haven\u0027t checked that out already you definitely should!).\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 5.5 -- 85% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 90-95% of AC (130-180% of FTP)\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 3\n\nRest between sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nInterval repeats per set: 3\n\n\u200B\n\n**Interval**\n\nWork: 30 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\nSteady: 2 minutes 30 seconds @ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n25 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR \u003C70%\n",

The blend between mind and body, working together to overcome hard moments\u2014be it physical, mental or emotional\u2014and how we learn to cope in our own mind is essential in being able to process the past, be true to ourselves in the present, and create moments of inner peace in the future.\n\n\u200B\n\nA decade after crossing the French Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es non-stop on a ride that would act as a catalyst for change, I wanted to share this story for the first time. To give an insight into the deeper meaning behind some of the mountain challenges you may have seen me undertake over the years, I felt now was the time to head back to my mountains, return to source, and embrace the unknown.\n\n\u200B\n\nOvercoming the mountains of our mind, from escapism to reconnection. 10 years, 10 cols and 10,000 meters of climbing. This is my story of going Full Circle.\n\n\u200B\n\nThank you for watching. I truly hope there is something in this video that can help you in your own journey.\n\n\u200B\n\nPeace,\n\nMike Cotty\u0022\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: The workout accompanying this film is a recovery session, which is a very low-intensity ride. It\u0027s so easy that your power remains at or below 50% of FTP or an RPE less than 2.5, and your heart rate stays in zone 1 the entire time. The intensity and cadence targets will vary throughout this session to keep it interesting (But not so interesting that you can\u0027t pay attention to the film).\n",

              "description": "This is a technique-focused session designed to develop your agility, stability, range of motion, and foot speed. There is no focus on heart rate zones so you may choose to leave your monitor at home for these sessions. Between sets of each drill, you should jog/walk easily to fully recover between the efforts. While these efforts shouldn\u2019t be too taxing on you, the key is perfect form, so you want to be hitting each one rested enough that you can maintain great form for the duration. You should take a bit of extra rest between techniques, again to ensure you are rested and can nail the form. Before starting the workout, familiarize yourself with the format for high knees, butt kicks, skipping, carioca and strides. Find a flat track, field, or 50-100m of open space to perform this workout (football and soccer fields are great for this).\n\n\u200B\n\nFor help understanding your run workout and calculating your pace zones, please see [this article](https://wahoosystm.com/RunningSessionFAQ).\n\nLearn how to perform your [**Running Drills**](https://support.wahoofitness.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404080091922-Running-Drills) here.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-up:**\n\nStart off with 5-10 minutes of easy jogging/walking.\n\nHigh Knees: 2-3 sets of 50m high knees.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- Take short strides, bringing your knees up high enough that your upper legs are parallel to the ground. Focus on achieving high knees AND quick turnover, or performing as many reps as possible in a short distance.\n\n**Butt Kicks:**\n\n2-3 sets of 50m butt kicks.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- This should actually look similar to a high knee drill, but with the heels coming up to touch the bottom of your butt. Take short strides while using your hamstrings to lift your heels up beneath your butt. Your knees should come up in front of your body while pulling your heels up beneath your hips, rather than keeping your quads and knees below and in line with your hips.\n\n**Skipping:**\n\n3-4 sets of 50m skipping.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- Focus on a high knee drive and swinging your arms at your sides like you would when running.\n\n**Carioca:**\n\n4 sets of 30m Carioca in each direction (8 total).\n\nRest for 20 seconds between direction changes (at your discretion).\n\n- For this drill, you need to face sidewise to the direction you want to go. Start off moving to the right. Bring your left knee up and across your body and put your left foot in front of your right foot. Step your right foot to the right so it is parallel with your left leg again (at this point you should be positioned in the same direction and orientation that you were at the start. Next step your left leg behind your right leg, again so it lands on the right side of your right leg. Then bring your right leg back across your body, once again ending up in the starting position. Repeat this pattern for 25-30m.\n\n**Strides:**\n\n2-3 sets of 60m; Gradually build effort from RPE 3-8.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between. These are comprised of a steady acceleration over 60-80m up to 5k pace. The goal is to increase speed after each step, so you are reaching maximum speed at the end of the 60-80m stretch. You want to focus on keeping your shoulders, neck, and jaw relaxed while maintaining strong knee drive, straight and compact arm swing, planting the feet beneath the hips, and fast turnover.\n\n\u200B\n\nHigh Knees \u002B Butt Kicks:\n\nFinish these drills with one set each of 50m high knees and butt kicks.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool-down:**\n\nWalk or jog for 5 minutes to cool down.\n\nIn case you need to brush up on your running [drills](https://wahoosystm.com/RunningSessionFAQ)\n",

Today\u0027s session is a low intensity workout that challenges you with a series of drills designed to reinforce proper technique that will make you a more efficient, powerful and faster swimmer.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n200m stroke of your choice @ RPE 2 -- Z1\n\n\u200B\n\n**Activation 1**\n\nNumber of Sets: 4\n\nInterval Distance: 25m Drill of your choice\n\nThe goal of a Drill set is not to swim at any given pace, but instead focus on proper form. Choose a drill or focus on one of these key points for each 25m interval:\n\n- \\*Body position- swim on horizontal plane\n- \\*Enter in front of shoulder- preventing cross over\n- \\*Breathe early- prevent wide stroke- elbow is always widest point\n- \\*Elbow is always the highest point of the stroke\n- \\*Back of hand always faces direction of travel\n- \\*Fingers to point at the bottom of pool\n- \\*Initiate your stroke from the hips\n\nRecovery: 10-sec rest\n\n\u200B\n\n**Activation 2**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nInterval Distance: 100m kick @ RPE 3-4 -- Z2\n\n- This drill requires you to only use your legs for propulsion. Face the sky with your arms extended above your head, biceps squeezing your ears. Kick from the hips with straight legs, toes just breaking the surface of the water. When you see the flags above your head, flip onto your belly so you don\u0027t hit the wall. Make note if there are no flags at your pool before doing this drill so you can look for another sign that the wall is near.\n\nRecovery: 20-sec rest\n\n\u200B\n\n**Activation 3**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nInterval Distance: 100m Pull @ RPE 3-4 -- Z2\n\n- This set eliminates the use of your legs to focus on your catch and pull. Squeeze a pull buoy between your legs to keep your hips afloat and body in the correct orientation.\n- While the back of the hand always faces the direction of travel and the elbow remains the highest point of the stroke, your leading hand spears the water and the Catch phase is initiated by obtaining a grasp on the water while reaching forward. This first phase is not about producing power, rather, it sets you up for the Pull and Push Phases. Imagine pulling yourself over a barrel. Hold as much water as possible while pulling, then pushing the water back to your thigh keeping the hand on the inside on the elbow. Your stroke should accelerate as you progress through the Pull and Push Phases. There is a subtle S formation that occurs during the phases, starting with the Pull Phase just above the shoulder and continuing through the Push Phase until your hand exits the water to begin the recovery phase. Always imagine a line dividing your body lengthwise, with your left arm staying on the left side and your right arm staying on the right side. Crossover will result in additional drag and unwanted sway in the lower body.\n\nRecovery: 20-sec rest\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Set**\n\nComplete at least six of the drills that you struggle the most with. Aim for 150-200m of each one. The only way to get better is to work on your weaknesses! So be honest with yourself and pick the drills you have the hardest time with.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n200m stroke of your choice @ RPE \u003C 2 -- Z1\n\n\u200B\n\n**Total Distance**\n\n2000m\n",

A small country in the Balkan Peninsula that hides some of the most beautiful natural wonders and unique cultural heritage in this part of the world. Yet it remains unknown to many. Only the alternative, curious and brave plan their journeys in this hidden gem. However, a small self-organized crew from Serbia and Germany set a mission to discover and reveal those stunning natural creations of Serbia. On a bicycle. In just five days, they traversed 450 kilometers across six mountains of Western Serbia, and climbed around 11,000 meters to film and produce what you are about to experience.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: The workout accompanying this film is a recovery session. It\u0027s a very low-intensity ride, with your power remaining at or below 50% of FTP (an RPE less than 2.5 on a scale from 1 to 10) and your heart rate in Zone 1. The intensity and cadence targets will vary throughout this session to keep it interesting, but not so much that it distracts you from the story.\n",

              "description": "This workout combines several technique driven intervals. These will improve your overall form and efficiency on the bike. The first two drills, Cadence Holds and Builds, are designed to improve the way you recruit your leg, glute and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke. They do this by forcing you to sustain a cadence just above \u0027comfortable\u0027 and by pushing you to your maximal cadence.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe last drill, Single Leg Efforts, ask you to unclip one leg and ride at a steady, single-legged effort. This forces you to pull up on the pedal instead of just pushing down and ensures maximal muscle awareness and engagement. This workout is best done while riding indoors on a trainer because even small variations in terrain can affect your ability to properly execute this workout. The majority of this workout is done in heart rate Z1/2 /// 50-75% of threshold /// RPE 2-5. You should keep the effort level below threshold (heart rate Z4, 100% of threshold, RPE 7-8) during the max cadence efforts.\n\n\u200B\n\nWORKOUT GOALS:\n\n- To improve stillness and stability at high cadences.\n- To improve muscle fiber engagement for improved efficiency at all cadences.\n- To increase maximum cadence.\n- To make that pedal stroke as smooth as butter.\n\nCADENCE TARGETS:\n\n- Warm-up 80-90rpm\n- Build: 90-150rpm\n- Hold: 115rpm\n- Single Leg: 85rpm\n\nListen to The Knowledge podcast, by Wahoo Sports Science - The Benefits of High Cadence Training: [https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence](https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n3 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 3\n\nRest Between Sets: 8 minutes @ RPE 23 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: N/A\n\n**Interval**\n\nCadence Build: 30 seconds @ RPE 8 -- Starting at 90RPM Build to Max RPM -- Max Power is NOT Goal\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nCadence Hold: 45 seconds @ RPE 7.5 -- \u003C100% FTP -- Highest RPM you can hold without Bouncing\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nSingle Leg: 1 minute @ RPE 6 -- Single Leg Only -- \u003C50% of FTP\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nSingle Leg: 1 minute @ RPE 6 -- Single Leg Only, Opposite Leg -- \u003C50% of FTP (100% of FTP with both legs = 50% of FTP\n\nwith one leg)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n8 minutes 15 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

              "description": "If you want a do-it-all session that will maintain and improve nearly every aspect of your fitness, _The Chores_ is just the ticket. This workout features 3 sets of intervals. Each set combines a series of 40-second efforts with 20-second recoveries, followed by an immediate transition to a sustained effort just below threshold. These short efforts with minimal recovery deplete your anaerobic gas tank, forcing your body to get better at producing power aerobically. This combination will help improve your Anaerobic Capacity, (AC) your Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP), and your Functional Threshold Power (FTP), all in just under an hour.\n\n\u200B\n\nAt the start of each set, your body starts to dip into your anaerobic reserves to help hit the high-power targets. Your body then starts to ramp up your oxygen intake in order to produce more of the power requirements aerobically. With such short recovery time between these efforts, your AC is steadily drained through each set. By the time the last short interval arrives, your body will be forced to produce almost all of that power aerobically, which will push your lungs to their very limit.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis is the optimal time to stress your body\u2019s ability to produce power at threshold. With your AC depleted (and your lungs and heart working near maximal capacity), the shorter sustained efforts that would normally be a piece of cake will have a bit more...sting. No matter what your preferred discipline, terrain, or distance, this session will make you fitter and faster.\n\n\u200B\n\nFeaturing exciting, on-bike camera footage from the Velon Hammer Series, _The Chores_ will make you earn your keep.\n",

In the same way that longer Tempo efforts can feel \u0022easy,\u0022 these shorter Sub-Threshold efforts can also feel \u0022easy\u0022. After all, if you can hold 100% of FTP for about an hour, then holding less than that for 5-minutes should be a piece of cake right? We know you can go harder for 5-minutes, but that is not what we are asking for.  \nThis session is not intended to push you to your limits, nor is it designed to be a massive training load. The real purpose is to essentially keep your fatigue levels right where they are, by giving your body just enough intensity to ensure that you are not \u0022more recovered\u0022 after today.  \nWhile some folks will say that there is no training benefit to such short Sub-Threshold efforts, when viewed in a bigger picture sense (like a 3-week training block) they can be the perfect efforts to ensure you get the most out of a longer training block.  \nWe would even ask that you view this session as more of an assessment, rather than strictly a workout. That\u0027s because you should be comparing this power output to heart rate response and your own internal RPE. When you have heavy fatigue, your heart rate will struggle to hit its normal peaks. When fresh you would be getting into Z4 heart rate by the end of the last two intervals, and your RPE should never really climb above a 7. When holding onto excess fatigue, your heart rate won\u0027t climb above Z3, and your RPE will be above an 8. At the same time, if you have gained a significant amount of fitness, your Heart Rate will stay in Z3, and your RPE won\u0027t climb above 6. The secondary tell between improved fitness and fatigue is how quickly your heart rate drops after each effort. When fatigued, your heart rate won\u0027t drop below Z2 during the recovery.  \nWhile it is easy to rely solely on Power, you should always refer back to RPE and Heart Rate, and today is the perfect session to practice comparing the 3.  \n  \n**Warm-Up **15 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%  \n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%  \n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C85%  \n1 minute @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR \u003C 90%  \n30 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C95%  \n30 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 115% of FTP  \n6 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%  \n  \n**Main Effort **Number of Sets: 3  \nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%  \nInterval Repeats per Set: 1  \n**Interval **Surge: 20 seconds @ RPE 9.5 -- 90% of AC (135-190%\u002B of FTP)  \nSteady: 15 minutes @ RPE 7 -- 90% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%  \n  \n**Extra Volume **NA  \n  \n**Cool Down **4 minutes @ RPE 1 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%  \n",

This session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s how to turn off on-screen graphics for the best viewing experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterInspiration)\n",

              "description": "The training benefit of this session comes down to the uncomfortably high cadence you need to hold during each effort. Even though these efforts are under FTP, the high leg speed required will leave your system working harder than usual for the required power output.\n\n\nBy maintaining the highest cadence possible (without bouncing in the saddle) you end up pushing your neuromuscular coordination near its limits in a similar way to Cadence Builds.\n\n\u200B\n\nWith an emphasis on low torque (high RPM) efforts, this session is the polar opposite to sessions like GOAT and Power Station. Even though these efforts are short and below FTP the high cadence places more of a load on your cardiovascular system, so expect your heart rate and breathing to be higher than normal for the power.\n\n\u200B\n\nSince muscles can only contract (pull) any given muscle will primarily move a joint in a single direction. When it comes to pedaling a bike, your quads and glutes can push the pedals down, while your hamstrings and hip flexors pull the pedals back up (with the help of your glutes and quads on the other leg). If you were to pedal with one leg (as you do in Cadence Drills) and your hamstrings and glutes were unable to contract, once you get to the bottom of the pedal stroke your leg would be stuck down there. No matter how hard you might try, your glutes and quads will do nothing to help you get that pedal all the way around. Suppose you do have both feet clipped in, and you are letting your opposite leg push down to bring your leg back up to 12 o\u0027clock. If your quads and glutes are still contracting (pushing the pedal down) while the glutes and quads of your other leg are starting to push their pedal down, you will end up with one leg working against the other. You must relax the glutes and quads of one leg to get all of the power out of the glutes and quads of your other leg.\n\nThis is where neuromuscular coordination comes into play. During each pedal revolution, your legs have to \u201Cswitch on\u201D and \u201Cswitch off\u201D almost all of the muscles in your legs. By maintaining your highest cadence without bouncing, you are pushing all of the muscles in each leg to contract and relax (switch on and off) as quickly as possible.\n\n\nWhile we give specific cadence targets in this session, everyone has a different limit to what cadence they can maintain before bouncing in the saddle.

The term \u0022Taper\u0022 refers to how you train in the week or so before your target event to ensure you deliver your best performance. Generally, tapering means reducing your total training volume but continuing to hit some high-intensity efforts. While there are individual variations in the best way to taper, this session has been used by countless professionals leading into the biggest races of their lives -- athletes like World Champions Rohan Dennis and Flora Duffy.\n\n\u200B\n\nWith 3 sets of micro-intervals (40/20s, 30/30s, and 20/40s) you will hit your system with just enough intensity to keep your legs sharp and responsive, without adding any real fatigue. Outside of those 3 sets of micro-intervals, this session is purposefully short and easy. This is a preparation session, not a training session! After all, your event is just around the corner and all of the important training is behind you. Riding harder or longer today will do absolutely nothing to increase your fitness by event day; in fact, all that would do is increase your fatigue, which will only hurt your performance. Rather, this session makes sure your body is humming along and ready to perform on the big day.\n",
