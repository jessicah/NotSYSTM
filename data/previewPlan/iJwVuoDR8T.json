Each session offers a progressive set of integrated exercises that includes a focus on the lower body, posterior chain and core, in addition to supplementary movements for the upper body.\n\n\u200B\n\nIn this first routine in the sequence, we\u0027ll introduce you to some basic foundational movement patterns that will help improve your running by enhancing lower body and core stability as well as strength. The exercises are simple and the interval durations are short. Utilize the full duration of the session to focus on quality technique using the full range of motion. As the program progresses you\u0027ll complete more variations for longer periods, so dial in that good form now.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Included Exercises:**\n\n- Squat Wide Stance Hands Forward\n- Single leg Hip Hinge\n- Squat w/ Hands Behind Head\n- Recoil Hamstring Stretch\n- Kneeling Hip Drive Hands Up\n- Kneeling Hips Side to Side\n- Foot Circles\n- Backward Lunge Arms on Hips\n- Backward Shoulder Rolls\n- Deep Squat w/Arms Crossed\n- Single Leg Heel Raise\n- Hip Hinge-Hands on Head\n- Side Lunge to Knee Lift w/ Hold\n- Frog Crunch\n- Oblique Leg Lifts\n- Bird Dog\n- Pigeon Stretch\n- Runner Stretch\n",
