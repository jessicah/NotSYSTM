      "description": "#### **Special Focus: Core Level 1**\n\nThis six week training plan is specifically designed to improve your core strength and pelvic stability, which is often neglected in endurance athletes. With three short focused sessions per week this is the perfect way to get in the extra time to concentrate on the three dimensional segment from shoulder to hip. You can add this as an off-season block or an extra bump to your regular season training. These workouts will target core muscles but will also include considerable demand for the smaller muscles of the upper body.\n\n\u200B\n\nLevel 1 is the place to start if you are new to training your core or if you are coming back after an extended lay-off of over six months. As with any of the SYSTM strength plans, take your time with each session and follow the proper progression to maximize gains.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis plan may be applied in conjunction with other Special Focused strength plans or with one of the 12 week add-ons for extra core training. However, if you add concurrent strength plans please be mindful that you are getting adequate recovery between workouts.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe Special Focus stand alone plans follow a 2:1 progression and have three sessions per week on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.\n\n\u200B\n\nHere we go!\n",
