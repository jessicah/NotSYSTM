Cadence builds improve how you recruit your leg, gluteal, and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke by progressing to your maximal cadence. By reaching your highest cadence possible, you are training the \u0027on/off\u0027 switch in each muscle group to not only work faster but to have less overlap with your other muscle groups. This session trains your hamstring muscles to \u0027turn off\u0027 when your quads \u0027turn on\u0027 and vice-versa, resulting in a more efficient pedal stroke at both high and low cadences.\n\n\u200B\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to The Knowledge podcast, by Wahoo Sports Science - The Benefits of High Cadence Training: [https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence](https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence)\n",

Better yet, why not add them together in a way that makes the session as challenging as possible?\n\n\u200B\n\nThe first 11 intervals from _Revolver_ ensure that your AC system has been repeatedly tapped so many times that your cardiovascular system is having to work overtime to compensate. Then just before you really reach the limit of your AC\u2019s ability to recover, we serve up shorter, higher intensity intervals with equally short recovery times. Those shorter efforts push your AC all the way to the edge and then over it. At this point, your cardiovascular system is left to take up the slack, forcing your body into new depths of anaerobic depletion. By the end of this workout, you will have pushed your AC and MAP to their breaking point. Your reward? The ability to hit them even harder the next time you need to put down multiple attacks or surges.\n",

This session is designed to sharpen muscle activation and improve recovery after intense efforts.\n\nFinish strong, and I\u2019ll see you in Burgberg!\n\n\u200B\n\nWith short near-maximal sprint efforts like these, you\u2019ll recruit all of the muscle fibers in your legs. While cadence builds force your muscles to contract and relax as quickly as possible, this session forces your muscles to contract with maximal power. Just like cadence builds, this session becomes one of the best ways to train your neuromuscular system.\n\nEven if your target event does not require you to complete maximal sprints, there is a substantial trickle-down efficiency effect to the longer-duration power efforts when you train your neuromuscular system.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/9866624296)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

In the same way that longer Tempo efforts can feel \u0022easy,\u0022 these shorter Sub-Threshold efforts can also feel \u0022easy\u0022. After all, if you can hold 100% of FTP for about an hour, then holding less than that for 8 minutes should be a piece of cake right? We know you can go harder for this short amount of time, but that is not what we are asking for.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session is not intended to push you to your limits, nor is it designed to be a massive training load. The real purpose is to essentially keep your fatigue levels right where they are, by giving your body just enough intensity to ensure that you are not \u0022more recovered\u0022 after today.\n\n\u200B\n\nWhile some folks will say that there is no training benefit to such short Sub-Threshold efforts, when viewed in a bigger picture sense (like a 3-week training block) they can be the perfect efforts to ensure you get the most out of a longer training block.\n\n\u200B\n\nWe would even ask that you view this session as more of an assessment, rather than strictly a workout. That\u0027s because you should be comparing this power output to heart rate response and your own internal RPE. When you have heavy fatigue, your heart rate will struggle to hit its normal peaks. When fresh you would be getting into Z4 heart rate by the end of the last two intervals, and your RPE should never really climb above a 7. When holding onto excess fatigue, your heart rate won\u0027t climb above Z3, and your RPE will be above an 8. At the same time, if you have gained a significant amount of fitness, your Heart Rate will stay in Z3, and your RPE won\u0027t climb above 6. The secondary tell between improved fitness and fatigue is how quickly your heart rate drops after each effort. When fatigued, your heart rate won\u0027t drop below Z2 during the recovery.\n\n\u200B\n\nWhile it is easy to rely solely on Power, you should always refer back to RPE and Heart Rate, and today is the perfect session to practice comparing the 3.\n\n\u200B\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C85%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C95%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 90-95% of AC (130-180% of FTP)\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 4\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 4\n\n**Interval**\n\nSurge: 30 sec @ RPE 8.5 -- 90% of MAP (105-130% of FTP)\n\nSteady: 1 minutes 30 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 90% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n13 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C85%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- \u003C45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right!\n\n\u200B\n\nMost people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022 Truth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted. So what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like?\n\nFor 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70% is ok, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm and your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster.

That\u0027s why Grunter von Agony, Sufferlandrian Team Director, is sending you to compete in The Omnium at the UCI World Track Championships. Over the course of 50 minutes, you\u0027ll do battle in the six different races.\n\n\u200B\n\nNo two intervals in this workout are the same, with each one working slightly different Neuromuscular (NM), Anaerobic Capacity (AC), and Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) variations. No need for FTP here, friends. It\u0027s the perfect session to improve top-end power without having to do a ton of repetitive efforts.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe Scratch Race and Flying Lap have an easy enough lead-in that you get to put your max sprint to the full test. Add in the standing starts for the Individual Pursuit and Kilo, and you give your NM a real run-through. The repeated surges of the Elimination Race, the all-out nature of the Kilo, and the massive efforts you have to make in the points race really test your powers of recovery while working your AC all the way to the max.\n\n\u200B\n\nSince the efforts come in quick succession, and with most being over four minutes in length, your cardiovascular system never catches a real break, ensuring your MAP doesn\u2019t get left out of the equation.\n",

The 22km climb is long, so we break it up into three sections for you. First, you\u0027ll have a nice long warm-up to ride into the village of Fabian. Once the proper climb starts, you\u0027ll ramp it up to a range between 70-90% threshold and hold it there. Toward the end, you\u0027ll start to work hard and finish off with an all-out assault on the summit. Along the way, you\u0027ll find out how the local wool is processed, how a network of ancient towers protected the region, why one house is covered in flowers, and what happened to all the local brown bears.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/3778259865)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

              "description": "Yep, there are good chunks of sub-threshold in here. But what makes this session special are the surges above threshold during each effort. Your body\u0027s ability to clear metabolites and process oxygen doesn\u0027t really change at 90% of FTP and above. What that means it that whether you are at 90% or 100% of FTP your body is clearing those things out at the same rate. It\u0027s just that at FTP your body is producing more of those metabolites that it is capable of clearing.\n\n\u200B\n\nBy surging above FTP you are creating metabolites faster than your body can clear them. If you were to settle into 100% of FTP, you would only be clearing things out at the rate you are producing them. That means whatever you have produced from that surge will just stay there. By dropping just below FTP your body is clearing things out faster than you are producing them. That means that the excess you got from that surge will slowly be cleared out.\n\n\u200B\n\nEach time a surge pops up during this workout, your body should have just about cleared what was made from the last surge. Not only does this push your body\u0027s ability to clear these things to the max, but it also teaches your mind to deal with the discomfort of burning lungs and legs associated with these efforts at or above threshold.\n\n\u200B\n\nA simpler way to think of this is that you are teaching your body and mind to \u0022recover\u0022 just below FTP. Not only does this help bump up your FTP, but it also helps you recover that much faster anytime you let off the gas, whether for a downhill, turn, or finding a good draft. Having the confidence that you can recover while feeling so uncomfortable can mean the difference between hanging onto to a new personal best and completely throwing in the towel.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis is the perfect session to practice your positive thinking from the Mental Toughness Program (If you haven\u0027t checked that out already you definitely should!).\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 5.5 -- 85% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 90-95% of AC (130-180% of FTP)\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 4\n\nRest between sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nInterval repeats per set: 4\n\n**Interval**\n\nWork: 30 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\nSteady: 2 minutes 30 seconds @ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n25 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR \u003C70%\n",

Cadence builds improve how you recruit your leg, gluteal, and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke by progressing to your maximal cadence. By reaching your highest cadence possible, you are training the \u0027on/off\u0027 switch in each muscle group to not only work faster but to have less overlap with your other muscle groups. This session trains your hamstring muscles to \u0027turn off\u0027 when your quads \u0027turn on\u0027 and vice-versa, resulting in a more efficient pedal stroke at both high and low cadences.\n\n\u200B\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to The Knowledge podcast, by Wahoo Sports Science - The Benefits of High Cadence Training: [https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence](https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence)\n",

              "description": "The training benefit of this session comes down to the uncomfortably high cadence you need to hold during each effort. Even though these efforts are under FTP, the high leg speed required will leave your system working harder than usual for the required power output.\n\nBy maintaining the highest cadence possible (without bouncing in the saddle) you end up pushing your neuromuscular coordination near its limits in a similar way to Cadence Builds.\n\n\u200B\n\nWith an emphasis on low torque (high RPM) efforts this session is polar opposite to sessions like GOAT and Power Station. Even though these efforts are short and below FTP the high cadence places more of a load on your cardiovascular system, so expect your heart rate and breathing to be higher than normal for the power.\n\n\u200B\n\nSince muscles can only contract (pull) any given muscle will primarily move a joint in a single direction. When it comes to pedaling a bike, your quads and glutes can push the pedals down, while your hamstrings and hip flexors pull the pedals back up (with the help of your glutes and quads on the other leg). If you were to pedal with one leg (as you do in Cadence Drills) and your hamstrings and glutes were unable to contract, once you get to the bottom of the pedal stroke your leg would be stuck down there. No matter how hard you might try, your glutes and quads will do nothing to help you get that pedal all the way around. Suppose you do have both feet clipped in, and you are letting your opposite leg push down to bring your leg back up to 12 o\u0027clock. If your quads and glutes are still contracting (pushing the pedal down) while the glutes and quads of your other leg are starting to push their pedal down, you will end up with one leg working against the other. You must relax the glutes and quads of one leg to get all of the power out of the glutes and quads of your other leg.\n\nThis is where neuromuscular coordination comes into play. During each pedal revolution, your legs have to \u201Cswitch on\u201D and \u201Cswitch off\u201D almost all of the muscles in your legs. By maintaining your highest cadence without bouncing, you are pushing all of the muscles in each leg to contract and relax (switch on and off) as quickly as possible.\n\nWhile we give specific cadence targets in this session, everyone has a different limit to what cadence they can maintain before bouncing in the saddle. To get the intended benefit of this session you need to maintain the power targets at the highest cadence that YOU can maintain. For some that might be 105RPM, for others, it might be 150RPM. What matters is that you push YOUR neuromuscular system to its limits.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n15 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of sets: 3\n\nRest between sets: 7 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nInterval repeats per: NA\n\n**Interval**\n\n3 minutes @ RPE 5 -- 80% of FTP -- 100\u002B RPM -- HR \u003C95%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

              "description": "You can never have too many tools in the shed. After years of lobbying, we finally convinced Grunter von Agony to share his favorite set of implements with us: the fabled _14 Vise Grips_. Taken individually, each of the 14 intervals might appear tame, incapable of inflicting a significant squeeze. But when expertly applied in the correct order, they apply just the right kind of pressure to turn a Couchlandrian into a Sufferlandrian, just like turning coal into diamonds.\n\n\u200B\n\nWhile the duration of each Vise Grip varies (from 30 seconds to 2 minutes), the power targets and recovery durations between them remain constant. The first 30-second interval should feel like a Sunday stroll in the park, but by the end of the first 2-minute Vise Grip, you\u0027ll be cursing Grunter\u0027s name. As the intervals get shorter, time will appear to stretch. That final 30-second effort will feel like an eternity. When you roll up to the second set, you\u0027ll know what you\u0027re in for, so just put your head down and prepare yourself to crush or be crushed.\n\n\u200B\n\nOnce you make it through all 14 Vise Grips, you will have been north of your Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) for a total of 16 minutes. Changing the duration of the efforts (while keeping the same recovery) stresses your Anaerobic Capacity (AC) in a more dynamic way than, say, a more straightforward on/off session like _Half is Easy_. Since the longer efforts have the same recovery duration as the shorter ones, you will eventually deplete your AC, forcing your body to rely on your MAP to hit the required power targets. As the intervals get shorter in the second half of each set, you\u0027ll find that you have just enough left in the tank to complete the next effort.\n\n\u200B\n\nUltimately this workout combines the advantages of shorter, higher-power intervals with longer recovery (great for building muscular strength) with the advantages of longer, higher-power intervals with inadequate recovery (great for driving up your MAP and improving your AC).\n",

This really depletes your body\u0027s AC, so you need to rely on your aerobic system. This helps develop your Maximal Aerobic Power.\n",

              "description": "The goal of this workout is to help develop your baseline aerobic fitness. While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are just times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right!\n\n\u200B\n\nMost people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022 Truth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted. So what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like?\n\nFor 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70% is ok, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm and your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster. You will have to trust us on that one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions! Or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 11\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 1\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

              "description": "This is a session that you\u0027ll want to complete in Level, rather than Erg, mode. The only time we would suggest Erg mode is if you are unable to maintain the lower power targets set between sprints.\n\nWith short maximal sprint efforts, you\u0027ll recruit every muscle fiber you have in your legs with each effort. While cadence builds force your muscles to contract and relax as quickly as possible, this session forces your muscles to contract with maximal force. Just like cadence builds this session becomes one of the best ways to train your neuromuscular system. Even if your target event does not require you to complete maximal sprints, there is a substantial trickle-down effect to the longer duration power efforts when you train your neuromuscular system.\n\nThis session is a great alternate to cadence builds or standing starts for those completing our SUF Strength sessions. On days you complete off the bike strength work you want your on bike training to complement the suffering you put yourself through off the bike. That means short maximal efforts (whether for power or for cadence) are the best workouts to complement the strength gains you\u0027ve made off the bike.\n\nAs long as you run this session in slope mode you can complete the sprints either seated or out of the saddle. For those competing in events that do not require much (if any) standing (such as Time Trials or Triathlons) you should complete these sprints seated (and in the aerobars or drops if that is where you are racing).\n\nYou should also do these efforts seated if you don\u0027t feel an out-of-the-saddle maximal sprint is stable/safe to do on your trainer. Regardless of using ERG or Slope mode, you do not want to hold anything back on any sprint. Seeing your peak power drop as the session goes on is totally normal as your legs fatigue. This is where RPE really becomes the most important metric, rather than power, heart rate, or cadence.\n\nNow get on that bike and CRUSH IT!\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of sets: 12\n\nRest between sets: 9 minutes 50 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nInterval repeats per set: NA\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 200% of FTP -- \u003E105%\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

In the first of a series of behind-the-scenes, unfiltered front-row access with team Lifeplus-Wahoo, MADE THIS is a collection of short films from MAAP Pro Team Racing that reveals what it takes to make a champion a champion.\n2. **Prepared for anything: **The excitement of Holy Week at the Tour de Flanders is upon us, and Team Lifeplus-Wahoo is gearing up for a challenging ride. With 163km to conquer, featuring 12 climbs and seven cobbled stretches, not to mention seven slippery flat stone sections\u2014all under a deluge of rain\u2014anything could happen.\n3. **Passion on the cobbles: **Join us as we dive deep into the chaotic and exhilarating world of the Paris-Roubaix, one of cycling\u0027s most grueling races. Amidst the cobblestones and mud, Team Lifeplus-Wahoo faces the ultimate test of endurance and skill. With a new lineup and high stakes, the team navigates the unpredictable nature of this legendary race, where luck can play a huge role and every second counts.\n4. **Home sweet home: **After a fallow year for the tour, the team are eager to push for results in front of an expectant crowd. But instead of the warm welcome on familiar roads, disaster strikes the first morning of the race. As national news of the unfortunate event breaks, the team are left wondering if they\u0027ll be able to compete or if this becomes a home visit to forget. What follows is a true act of human kindness and a gesture that symbolises the unifying bond of the women\u0027s pro peloton.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: The workout accompanying this film is a recovery session. It\u0027s a very low-intensity ride, with your power remaining at or below 50% of FTP (an RPE less than 2.5 on a scale from 1 to 10) and your heart rate in Zone 1.

              "description": "This brutal but straightforward workout is perfect for developing both FTP and MAP while teaching you a Negative Split pacing strategy. For this workout, you will complete a series of 4-minute efforts. The first 3-minutes are right at your FTP, which isn\u0027t so tough in itself, but the final 1-minute of each effort are set above 90% of MAP.\n\n\u200B\n\nWhen we talk about a \u0022negative split\u0022 we mean completing the second half of an effort at a higher speed/power than the first half. By the time you hit the MAP portion of each interval, your heart rate and breathing rate will already be nice and high. This limits the AC demand of a standalone MAP effort, where you have a large lag time between producing the power requirement, and your body delivering the oxygen needed to hold that power. Usually, that lag time between oxygen demand and oxygen supply is covered by your AC. Paced correctly, your heart rate should essentially be increasing for the entire 4-minutes, as it will be settling into LTHR right as you up the power output.\n\n\u200B\n\nAs you complete each effort, holding 100% of FTP will feel harder and harder. This in itself is excellent mental practice for \u0022feeling\u0022 how your RPE for the same power can drift up as fatigue sets in. Knowing what 100% of FTP feels like when your legs are nearly spent is a great reminder of why starting an effort too hard will bite you in the end.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis workout ends up delivering a fantastic aerobic workload as you complete 8-minutes of MAP work with minimal help from your AC, making this an excellent session for those who have a strong AC but weak MAP. You also rack up 24-minutes at 100% of FTP, which by itself would be a good training load. Add in these MAP efforts, and you multiply the training impact of those 24-minutes.\n\n\u200B\n\nRegardless of your chosen discipline or event, this is a session that will benefit everyone, both regarding learning good pacing and giving your aerobic system a big training boost.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C85%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C95%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 90% of MAP (105-135% of FTP)\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 2\n\nRest Between Sets: 15 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 4\n\n**Interval**\n\nFTP Effort: 3 minutes @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\nVO2 Effort: 1 minute @ RPE 9 -- 90-95% of MAP (105-130% of FTP) \n\nRecovery: 5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70% \n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n4 minutes @ RPE 1 -- \u003C45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

If you find a section that you struggle to hit cleanly, repeat that section a few times until you feel comfortable with it. Don\u2019t feel the need to practice every section you struggle with on a single ride, you can always come back another day! Keep the effort below 85% of FTP at all times and spend the bulk of the ride around 60% of FTP.\n\n\u200B\n\nMake sure to warm up well and cool down afterwards.\n",

While it\u0027s not as comprehensive or as accurate as our main fitness test, _Full Frontal_, it\u0027s far more approachable and easier to pace for new riders. It also doesn\u0027t require any special preparation. You just need to feel relatively fresh.\n\n\u200B\n\nBased on more than a year of research (and after dozens of lab tests and thousands of online tests) and using sophisticated analysis of power and heart rate data, _Half Monty_ is far more accurate and comprehensive than standard ramp tests.\n\n\u200B\n\nIt also tells you more about who you are as an athlete. _Half Monty_ provides you with your FTP, Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP), and Cycling Threshold Heart Rate (cTHR), all of which we use to personalize your workout targets.\n\n\u200B\n\nIf you\u0027re still using the 4DP estimates when you set up your account, _Half Monty_ will also refine your AC and NM estimates (but will not do so if you\u0027ve done _Full Frontal_ or manually adjusted your estimates). If you want fully accurate AC and NM, as well as your Rider Type, Strengths, Weaknesses, and training plans adjusted to those Strengths and Weaknesses, you\u0027ll need to expose yourself to the _Full Frontal_ 4DP fitness test.\n\n\u200B\n\nReady to climb the ramp? You\u0027ll need the following before you start:\n\n- A heart rate monitor if you want the most accurate results. Don\u0027t have one? Order one [HERE](https://wahoofitness.com/devices)\n- Some kind of power device connected (trainer, power meter, virtual power, etc.)\n- Be ready to pay close attention to the instructions in the workout\n- Be sure your profile is complete and up-to-date (Profile \u003E About You). Accurate information helps us make our calculations\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to \u0027[Why Fitness Testing Matters](https://the-knowledge-by-wahoo-sports-science.simplecast.com/episodes/testing-testing-1-2-3-why-fitness-testing-matters)\u0027 on The Knowledge Podcast by Wahoo Sports Science.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s some more information on how to get the most from your fitness test.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterFitnessAssessment)\n",

              "description": "The goal of this workout is to help develop your baseline aerobic fitness. While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high and your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week. Shorter Endurance rides (like this one) can fit in both a hard week of training and a recovery week. That is, only if you do it right! Most people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022\n\n\u200B\n\nTruth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride, especially one under 90 minutes should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted.\n\nSo what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like? For 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70%, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in low to mid Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can; for most this is 80-90rpm. Also, your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster, but you will have to trust us on this one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions, or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: 2\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nNA\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

              "description": "If you want a do-it-all session that will maintain and improve nearly every aspect of your fitness, _The Chores_ is just the ticket. This workout features 3 sets of intervals. Each set combines a series of 40-second efforts with 20-second recoveries, followed by an immediate transition to a sustained effort just below threshold. These short efforts with minimal recovery deplete your anaerobic gas tank, forcing your body to get better at producing power aerobically. This combination will help improve your Anaerobic Capacity, (AC) your Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP), and your Functional Threshold Power (FTP), all in just under an hour.\n\n\u200B\n\nAt the start of each set, your body starts to dip into your anaerobic reserves to help hit the high-power targets. Your body then starts to ramp up your oxygen intake in order to produce more of the power requirements aerobically. With such short recovery time between these efforts, your AC is steadily drained through each set. By the time the last short interval arrives, your body will be forced to produce almost all of that power aerobically, which will push your lungs to their very limit.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis is the optimal time to stress your body\u2019s ability to produce power at threshold. With your AC depleted (and your lungs and heart working near maximal capacity), the shorter sustained efforts that would normally be a piece of cake will have a bit more...sting. No matter what your preferred discipline, terrain, or distance, this session will make you fitter and faster.\n\n\u200B\n\nFeaturing exciting, on-bike camera footage from the Velon Hammer Series, _The Chores_ will make you earn your keep.\n",

              "description": "The 3x25-minute sub-threshold workout is one of the most classic interval sessions out there, so prepare for a trip to the northern Painlands for this FTP-builder. The reason the 3x25 sub-threshold workout is so popular is that it is easy to follow, helps teach good pacing, and gives you a great threshold training stimulus.\n\n\u200B\n\nIn this case, you\u0027re looking at three, (roughly) 25-minute blocks at around 90% of your FTP, an effort we refer to as \u0022Sub-Threshold\u0022. Many refer to this intensity as \u0022Sweet-Spot\u0022, but we prefer Sub-Threshold, as the real key is to never let your power creep above your FTP. Staying just below threshold ensures that your effort remains at an intensity you know your body can handle but that is close to what would not be sustainable.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe only way you\u0027re going to make it through three of these efforts is if you pace yourself properly. Everyone feels just fine for the first 5 minutes of the first effort, and are often tempted to go harder. Don\u0027t be that person. More often than not, that person blows up spectacularly in the second interval, unable to finish the session. Or they have to ride that second interval at lower power, turning it into a Tempo session, which is not the goal.\n\n\u200B\n\nGetting a sense of how these efforts \u0022bite\u0022 towards the end is vital to learning how to pace yourself over longer steady-state efforts; whether that\u0027s a time trial, local climb, breakaway, triathlon, or even a good old fitness test. In each of those cases, the pacing is key. Learning how your perceived effort can steadily climb even though your power remains unchanged is critical to good pacing.\n\n\u200B\n\nSo how do you know if you are doing this one right? As we said, the first 5 minutes should feel relatively easy. Around that 5-minute mark, your heart rate should stop climbing, and settle into 2-5% below your Lactate Threshold Heart Rate (LTHR). If your heart rate is climbing for the entire effort and goes above your LTHR, then you are going too hard.\n\nIf you hit the 10-minute mark, your legs feel fine, and your heart rate is still in Zone 3, then you aren\u0027t going hard enough.\n\nIf you\u0027ve never done a session like this before, you can consider only doing the first 20-minute effort, or even sticking to just the first 15 minutes of each effort. There\u0027s no shame in building up to this full session, so don\u0027t be afraid to pause and fast forward as needed.\n\n\u200B\n\nNailing this session is really about getting in tune with your body and understanding what the edge between a sustainable and an unsustainable effort feels like. Not being able to complete this workout is fairly common, so don\u0027t beat yourself up if you can\u0027t make it through the first few times. As long as you come away from this session with a better understanding of how to pace longer efforts, you\u0027ve improved as an athlete.\n",

              "description": "This brutal but straightforward workout is perfect for developing both FTP and MAP while teaching you a Negative Split pacing strategy. For this workout, you will complete a series of 4-minute efforts. The first 3-minutes are right at your FTP, which isn\u0027t so tough in itself, but the final 1-minute of each effort are set above 90% of MAP.\n\n\u200B\n\nWhen we talk about a \u0022negative split\u0022 we mean completing the second half of an effort at a higher speed/power than the first half. By the time you hit the MAP portion of each interval, your heart rate and breathing rate will already be nice and high. This limits the AC demand of a standalone MAP effort, where you have a large lag time between producing the power requirement, and your body delivering the oxygen needed to hold that power. Usually, that lag time between oxygen demand and oxygen supply is covered by your AC. Paced correctly, your heart rate should essentially be increasing for the entire 4-minutes, as it will be settling into LTHR right as you up the power output.\n\n\u200B\n\nAs you complete each effort, holding 100% of FTP will feel harder and harder. This in itself is excellent mental practice for \u0022feeling\u0022 how your RPE for the same power can drift up as fatigue sets in. Knowing what 100% of FTP feels like when your legs are nearly spent is a great reminder of why starting an effort too hard will bite you in the end.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis workout ends up delivering a fantastic aerobic workload as you complete 8-minutes of MAP work with minimal help from your AC, making this an excellent session for those who have a strong AC but weak MAP. You also rack up 24-minutes at 100% of FTP, which by itself would be a good training load. Add in these MAP efforts, and you multiply the training impact of those 24-minutes.\n\n\u200B\n\nRegardless of your chosen discipline or event, this is a session that will benefit everyone, both regarding learning good pacing and giving your aerobic system a big training boost.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C85%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C95%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 90% of MAP (105-135% of FTP)\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 2\n\nRest Between Sets: 15 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 4\n\n**Interval**\n\nFTP Effort: 3 minutes @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\nVO2 Effort: 1 minute @ RPE 9 -- 90-95% of MAP (105-130% of FTP) \n\nRecovery: 5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70% \n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n4 minutes @ RPE 1 -- \u003C45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

              "description": "The goal of this workout is to help develop your baseline aerobic fitness. While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are just times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs. This session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week. Shorter Endurance rides (like this one) can fit in both a hard week of training and a recovery week. That is, only if you do it right!\n\nMost people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022\n\nSo what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like?\n\nFor 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70%, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.)\n\nYour heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm\n\nAlso, your RPE should be a 2-3\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster. You will have to trust us on that one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions! Or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 13\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C85%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

And through the bleeding eyes of Sufferlandrians, what could possibly be more beautiful than the sharp, saw-tooth profile of the workout you see before you? Full of gorgeous, shapely, shimmering blocks of yellow Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) efforts interspersed with mercifully brief and slightly inadequate recoveries, it\u0027s a real stunner.\n\n\u200B\n\nBut you know what\u0027s even better looking than this alluring workout? You (after you\u0027ve completed the workout, that is). Originally designed by our Head of Sports Science, Neal Henderson, for his professional athletes, The Model is a beautiful portrait of MAP brutality. It\u0027s one of those sessions that you think you can\u0027t finish, but always somehow do. It will leave you breathless, feeling all tingly, a bit confused and lying in a blubbering heap. It\u0027s a look. It will also deliver a nice boost to your fitness that always looks and feels good.\n\n\u200B\n\nA true love letter to the beauty of professional cycling, The Model features a banging soundtrack and thrilling footage from both the men\u0027s and women\u0027s pelotons. With its eclectic design, effects, and graphics, you\u0027ll find yourself unable to tear your eyes away from the action on screen (assuming you can lift them from your stem).\n",

              "description": "This brutal but straightforward workout is perfect for developing both FTP and MAP while teaching you a Negative Split pacing strategy. For this workout, you will complete a series of 6-minute efforts. The first 4-minutes are right at your FTP, which isn\u0027t so tough in itself, but the final 2-minutes of each effort are set above 90% of MAP.\n\n\u200B\n\nWhen we talk about a \u0022negative split\u0022 we mean completing the second half of an effort at a higher speed/power than the first half. By the time you hit the MAP portion of each interval, your heart rate and breathing rate will already be nice and high. This limits the AC demand of a standalone MAP effort, where you have a large lag time between producing the power requirement, and your body delivering the oxygen needed to hold that power. Usually, that lag time between oxygen demand and oxygen supply is covered by your AC. Paced correctly, your heart rate should essentially be increasing for the entire 6-minutes, as it will be settling into LTHR right as you up the power output.\n\n\u200B\n\nAs you complete each effort, holding 100% of FTP will feel harder and harder. This in itself is excellent mental practice for \u0022feeling\u0022 how your RPE for the same power can drift up as fatigue sets in. Knowing what 100% of FTP feels like when your legs are nearly spent is a great reminder of why starting an effort too hard will bite you in the end.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis workout ends up delivering a fantastic aerobic workload as you complete 12-minutes of MAP work with minimal help from your AC. Making this an excellent session for those who have a strong AC, but weak MAP. You also rack up 24-minutes at 100% of FTP, which by itself would be a good training load. Add in these MAP efforts, and you multiply the training impact of those 24-minutes.\n\n\u200B\n\nRegardless of your chosen discipline or event, this is a session that will benefit everyone, both regarding learning good pacing and giving your aerobic system a big training boost.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR \u003C100\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort** x2\n\nNumber of sets:\n\nRest between sets: 30 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nInterval repeats per set: 3\n\n**Interval**\n\nEffort 1: 4 minutes @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\nEffort 2: 2 minutes @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\nRest: 5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n50 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minute @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR \u003C70%\n",

While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are just times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right!\n\nMost people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022 Truth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted. So what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like?\n\nFor 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70% is ok, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm and your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster. You will have to trust us on that one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions! Or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 14\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 1\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

As we climb through the pine forest we\u2019ll switch things up a touch, alternating between low and high cadence for 30 seconds at a time for around 7 minutes. We\u2019ll then revert back to our 50 second high tempo with 10 second burst out of the saddle efforts before we build up our effort to the summit. This is going to be a challenging workout so make sure you\u2019re ready and whatever you do don\u2019t forget to take a moment to look at the views!!\n\n\u200B\n\nThis workout combines multiple different interval types that focus on improving threshold power via over-under style efforts along with low cadence work for your muscular endurance. The first and last climbs also fire up your whole energy systems with some sprints to the summit.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/8735613403)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

However, that accumulated time is split up over two sets of 5 efforts, each 2-minutes in length. The goal of this session is to accumulate a significant amount of time near VO2max, or the point at which your body is consuming as much oxygen as it possibly can. That means your heart rate and breathing rate will both be near their max by the end of the 4th and 5th interval in each set.\n\n\u200B\n\nSince it takes time for your heart rate and breathing rate to match your effort, for the first part of each interval, you will be taping into your Anaerobic Capacity to produce the required power. Limited recovery ensures that your Anaerobic Capacity is drained before the end of either set, forcing your body to produce as much power as possible aerobically. By splitting these efforts into two sets, you will be producing more power anaerobically compared to doing all ten intervals in a single set. While this means you accumulate less time near your VO2max, you will be able to hold a higher power for the final five intervals. Splitting the efforts will shift the training stress away from your cardiovascular system and onto your muscular system.\n\nUltimately this session will improve your ability to produce power aerobically in addition to improving your muscular strength and endurance, both of which are key to increasing your MAP and your FTP.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR \u003C70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 150% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n5minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of sets: 2\n\nRest between sets: 20 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nInterval repeats per set: 5\n\n**Interval**\n\nWork: 2 minutes @ RPE 9 -- 95-105%% of MAP (115-135% of FTP)\n\nRest: 2 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n30 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR \u003C70%\n",

              "description": "The goal of this workout is to help develop your baseline aerobic fitness. While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are just times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right!\n\nMost people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022 Truth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted. So what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like?\n\nFor 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70% is ok, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm and your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster. You will have to trust us on that one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions! Or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 14\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 1\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

The session is based on a combination of specific micro-intervals (made famous by Japanese coach and physiologist Izumi Tabata) that we combined with classic tempo efforts. This gives you a superb mix of Anaerobic Capacity (AC), Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP), and FTP training stresses in one short workout to help you go faster and stay stronger for longer.\n\n\u200B\n\nNow, for the sports science purists among you, the \u0027Tabata\u0027 intervals should actually be named \u0027Koichi\u0027 intervals, since it was Japanese speedskating coach Irisawa Koichi who first employed the use of the 20-seconds on / 10-seconds off intervals that Dr. Izumi then confirmed via physiology lab studies to yield the best mix of maximal aerobic and anaerobic stress among the different on/off protocols that he tested.\n\n\u200B\n\nFor this workout, we have toned down the original intensity of the Tabata intervals to target MAP rather than Anaerobic Capacity in order to be able to complete the 20/10 micro-intervals and then follow the short efforts immediately with sustained 80-100% of FTP intervals to replicate the kind of attack and then settle efforts that are common in cycling races.\n\n\u200B\n\nFrom a physiological perspective, you\u2019ll produce lots of lactate during the micro-intervals. Then the goal of the tempo and FTP efforts is to stress your body\u2019s capacity to clear that lactate as quickly as possible. Effectively, we\u2019re trying to maximize lactate \u0027flux.\u0027 For each successive round of the efforts, you\u2019ll do one less micro-interval, and the tempo efforts will get shorter. But because you\u2019re a Sufferlandrian, they won\u2019t get easier, and the rest between sets will get shorter. The intensity for the tempo efforts will ramp up with each repetition. Fortunately for you, there are only 3 sets of efforts and you\u2019ll be done in just 30 minutes. If you\u2019ve set aside an hour for this workout, you\u2019ll be happy to have those additional 30 minutes for recovery after this session.\n",

It trains your ability to generate force through the pedals by ensuring you recruit ALL of your muscles to get that crank turning. No matter your preferred discipline, these efforts are key to teaching your body to recruit all of the muscle fibers in your legs. The saying \u201CUse it or Lose it\u201D actually does apply here.\n\n\u200B\n\nAll of the benefits in this session come from hitting these 20-second efforts as hard as you possibly can. To do that, you need full recovery between each sprint, and you need to respect that recovery! These efforts should see you start at super low RPMs with very high torque. As you start and increase the effort, your cadence will naturally increase. Your goal is to get your cadence as high as possible by the end of each 20-second effort. To maximize your muscle recruitment, you want to both push down and pull up on the pedals at the start. Proper core engagement is a must - your legs need a good strong backboard to push against.\n\n\u200B\n\nWe understand that not everyone\u0027s trainer has the necessary resistance or the required stability to perform this workout as described. If you can\u0027t safely stand up, then you can get much of the same benefit by doing these efforts seated. If your trainer can\u2019t handle the rapid change in speed or does not have high enough resistance at a super low cadence, then you can start the efforts at a higher cadence and treat them as \u201Cnormal\u201D all-out sprints.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n3 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C 80%\n\n6 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C75%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: N/A\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 6\n\n**Interval **\n\nStanding Start: 20 seconds @ RPE 10 --\n\nStarting from standing (or very very very slow rolling) starts in a 53x14 gear.

              "description": "One of the best sessions for neuromuscular training, this drill asks you to progressively build from a cadence of 90 RPM to your MAX over 30 seconds, recover, and repeat several times. Cadence builds improve how you recruit your leg, gluteal, and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke by progressing to your maximal cadence. By reaching your highest cadence possible, you are training the \u0027on/off\u0027 switch in each muscle group to not only work faster but to have less overlap with your other muscle groups. This session trains your hamstring muscles to \u0027turn off\u0027 when your quads \u0027turn on\u0027 and vice-versa, resulting in a more efficient pedal stroke at both high and low cadences.\n\n\u200B\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to The Knowledge podcast, by Wahoo Sports Science - The Benefits of High Cadence Training: [https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence](https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence)\n",

The term \u0022Taper\u0022 refers to how you train in the week or so before your target event to ensure you deliver your best performance. Generally, tapering means reducing your total training volume but continuing to hit some high-intensity efforts. While there are individual variations in the best way to taper, this session has been used by countless professionals leading into the biggest races of their lives -- athletes like World Champions Rohan Dennis and Flora Duffy.\n\n\u200B\n\nWith 3 sets of micro-intervals (40/20s, 30/30s, and 20/40s) you will hit your system with just enough intensity to keep your legs sharp and responsive, without adding any real fatigue. Outside of those 3 sets of micro-intervals, this session is purposefully short and easy. This is a preparation session, not a training session! After all, your event is just around the corner and all of the important training is behind you. Riding harder or longer today will do absolutely nothing to increase your fitness by event day; in fact, all that would do is increase your fatigue, which will only hurt your performance. Rather, this session makes sure your body is humming along and ready to perform on the big day.\n",
