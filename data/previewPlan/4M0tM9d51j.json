While the first few efforts in each set will feel \u0022easy,\u0022 since these blocks are stretched out to 8-minutes in length, you will be deep into the red by the end of each set.\n\nWhile the efforts aren\u0027t continuous, they are long enough that you will accumulate plenty of time near your VO2max, which is the goal of any MAP workout. The real kicker from this session is how much time you spend at 100% of MAP. Each 8-minute set gives you 5 minutes and 20-seconds of time at your 5-minute peak power. By the end, you are looking at 16 minutes of accumulated MAP efforts, so expect this one to bring some pain!\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n1 minute 30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute 15 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 4 -- 70% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 150% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n1 minute 30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of sets: 3\n\nRest between sets: 5 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nInterval repeats per set: 8\n\n\u200B\n\n**Interval**\n\nWork: 40 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\nRest: 20 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n3 minutes 45 seconds @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR \u003C70%\n",

Riders who use this session leading up to an event include world champions Rohan Dennis and Flora Duffy.\n\n\nWith 3 sets of micro-intervals (40/20s, 30/30s, and 20/40s) you will be hitting your system with just enough intensity to keep your legs sharp and responsive, without adding any real fatigue to your system.\n\n\nOutside of those 3 sets of micro-intervals, this session is purposefully short and easy. If you are doing this session your event is just around the corner, and all of the important training is behind you.

              "description": "This is one of the most classic interval sessions out there. Whether you\u0027re a triathlete, a roadie, a mountain biker, or have simply flipped through cycling magazines looking at whatever workouts they might suggest in their \u00225-workouts to make you faster\u0022 articles, you\u0027ve probably heard of the venerable 1 x 20.\n\nThe reason it\u0027s so popular is that it\u0027s easy to follow, helps teach good pacing, and gives you a great threshold training stimulus.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe only way you are going to make it through any 20-minute effort is if you pace yourself properly. Everyone feels just fine for the first 5-minutes of the first effort, and most people are tempted to go harder. Do NOT be that person. 99 times out a 100, that person blows up spectacularly in the second interval, and never even makes to the last 10 minutes. Or they have to ride that second interval at lower power, turning it into a Tempo session, which is not the goal.\n\nGetting a sense of how these efforts \u0022bite\u0022 towards the end is vital to learning how to pace yourself over longer steady state efforts. Whether that is a Time Trial, local Climb, breakaway, Triathlon, or even a good old Power Test. In each of those cases, the pacing is key, seeing how your perception of how hard the effort is can steadily climb even though your power remains the same.\n\n\u200B\n\nSo how do you know if you are doing this one right? As we said, the first 5 minutes should feel relatively easy. Around that 5-minute mark, your heart rate should stop climbing, and settle into 2-5% below your LTHR. If your heart rate is climbing for the entire effort and goes above your LTHR, then you are going too hard.\n\nIf you hit the 10-minute mark, your legs feel fine, and your heart rate is still in Zone 3, then you aren\u0027t going hard enough. If you have never done a session like this before, you can consider only doing the first 20-minute effort, or even sticking to just the first 15 of each effort. There is no shame in building up to this full session, so don\u0027t be afraid to pause and fast forward as needed.\n\n\u200B\n\nNailing this session is really about getting in tune with your body, and understanding what that edge feels like, between a sustainable and an unsustainable effort. That means failing this workout is fairly common, and not at all something to get down about. As long as you learn from the experience\u2014for example, what \u0022too hard\u0022 feels like 10-minutes in\u2014then you\u0027ve become a better athlete, even if you didn\u0027t make it through the entire workout.\n",
