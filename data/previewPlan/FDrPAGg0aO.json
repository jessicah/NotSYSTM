              "description": "Meandering along the scenic River Iller, it\u2019s time to break out your gravel bike for a classic cadence build and hold session. We\u2019ll kick off with 5 x 30-second cadence builds, allowing for 2 minutes of recovery between each, before moving on to 5 x 60-second cadence holds, again with 2 minutes recovery.\n\nWhile this session may be short, it\u2019s a key part of your weekly plan, designed to keep you efficient and in top form, even when the cadence ramps up. Stay smooth and steady\u2014and remember, \u201Cno bobbing!\u201D\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Builds:** The name of the game here is absolute peak cadence, not peak power. To achieve this, you need to be in a small gear and have very light resistance. Starting at 90-RPM, steadily increase your cadence until you reach your absolute max with about 5-seconds left, and hold that to the end. Your limiting factor on these efforts needs to be leg speed. If resistance/power output is your limiting factor, try starting in an easier gear, or shift into an easier gear 15-seconds in. Bouncing in the saddle is okay for this drill.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Holds**: These efforts require you to maintain the highest cadence you can without starting to bounce in the saddle. For some of you that will be 100-RPM, for others, it will be 150-RPM. The key is to settle into YOUR peak sustainable cadence. Like the Builds, the goal here is not high power, so these efforts are limited to 90% of FTP. Do not be surprised if your heart rate is well into Zone 4 by the time you hit the last few holds.\n\n\nTo properly execute this session, your effort between drills needs to be low. With limited recovery time between these maximal Neuromuscular Efforts, riding above Zone 1 between efforts will only reduce your ability to max out your cadence. While the power targets between are Zone 1, do not be surprised if your heart rate does not drop below Zone 2 after the first couple builds.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/9885886076)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty. As founder of The Col Collective, Mike has made a career out of riding, filming, and telling the story of epic rides and mountains across the continent. As your On Location co-creator and host, Mike\u0027s engaging character, curious mind, and friendly nature will have you cueing up your next ride with him before you\u0027ve even finished the cool-down._\n",

Even for an hour? Well, now\u0027s your chance. _Getting Away With It_ gets you out of the office and onto the roads of the French Pyrenees with your guide Michael Cotty of The Col Collective.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis is a great session to add toward the end of a training block. The shorter duration, sub-threshold efforts are fantastic for getting some extra FTP building while you are in a fatigued state. Extra emphasis on cadence stresses your nervous system, making your body more efficient at higher and lower RPMs while improving your form. The Neuromuscular training you get from this session is fantastic, so while your power never exceeds threshold, your body will learn to bring more energy to the pedals at all intensities.\n",

              "description": "The goal of this workout is to help develop your baseline aerobic fitness. While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high and your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week. Shorter Endurance rides (like this one) can fit in both a hard week of training and a recovery week. That is, only if you do it right! Most people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022\n\n\u200B\n\nTruth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride, especially one under 90 minutes should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted.\n\nSo what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like? For 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70%, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in low to mid Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can; for most this is 80-90rpm. Also, your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster, but you will have to trust us on this one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions, or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: 4\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nNA\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

              "description": "This workout combines several technique driven intervals. These will improve your overall form and efficiency on the bike. The first two drills, Cadence Holds and Builds, are designed to improve the way you recruit your leg, glute and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke. They do this by forcing you to sustain a cadence just above \u0027comfortable\u0027 and by pushing you to your maximal cadence.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe last drill, Single Leg Efforts, ask you to unclip one leg and ride at a steady, single-legged effort. This forces you to pull up on the pedal instead of just pushing down and ensures maximal muscle awareness and engagement. This workout is best done while riding indoors on a trainer because even small variations in terrain can affect your ability to properly execute this workout. The majority of this workout is done in heart rate Z1/2 /// 50-75% of threshold /// RPE 2-5. You should keep the effort level below threshold (heart rate Z4, 100% of threshold, RPE 7-8) during the max cadence efforts.\n\n\u200B\n\nWORKOUT GOALS:\n\n- To improve stillness and stability at high cadences.\n- To improve muscle fiber engagement for improved efficiency at all cadences.\n- To increase maximum cadence.\n- To make that pedal stroke as smooth as butter.\n\nCADENCE TARGETS:\n\n- Warm-up 80-90rpm\n- Build: 90-150rpm\n- Hold: 115rpm\n- Single Leg: 85rpm\n\nListen to The Knowledge podcast, by Wahoo Sports Science - The Benefits of High Cadence Training: [https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence](https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n3 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 3\n\nRest Between Sets: 8 minutes @ RPE 23 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: N/A\n\n**Interval**\n\nCadence Build: 30 seconds @ RPE 8 -- Starting at 90RPM Build to Max RPM -- Max Power is NOT Goal\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nCadence Hold: 45 seconds @ RPE 7.5 -- \u003C100% FTP -- Highest RPM you can hold without Bouncing\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nSingle Leg: 1 minute @ RPE 6 -- Single Leg Only -- \u003C50% of FTP\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nSingle Leg: 1 minute @ RPE 6 -- Single Leg Only, Opposite Leg -- \u003C50% of FTP (100% of FTP with both legs = 50% of FTP\n\nwith one leg)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n8 minutes 15 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

              "description": "While you\u0027re certainly going to feel this workout in your legs, it\u0027s what happens in your head over these six intervals that matter most. A sort of \u0027Applied Mental Training Program\u0027 session is a unique addition to the SUF library.\n\n\u200B\n\nOver the course of the workout, you\u0027ll be taken through six different mental toughness tasks drawn from the SYSTM Mental Training Program (available here in the app). We\u0027ll teach you how to focus, use positive self-talk, and see an image of Future You to help you push through the Suffering.\n\n\u200B\n\nFrom a physical point of view, this is a series of five-minute intervals with very high Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) efforts at both ends. They pack the same training punch as much longer Sub-Threshold efforts with the added bonus of stimulating your MAP and Anaerobic Capacity (AC) simultaneously.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Physiologically**: The first 30-second effort digs you into an anaerobic hole. Even though it is a MAP-based target, your heart rate and breathing rates (and thus ability to deliver oxygen) are still low, so your body must produce much of this power anaerobically. By the time you settle into the 4-minutes at just below FTP, your body will have produced an excess of metabolites responsible for that burning in your legs. Only by riding below FTP will your body clear them out since FTP is the tipping point where your body produces metabolites at the same rate it is clearing them. By holding you at FTP, your body cannot clear out that excess, forcing you to deal with the associated discomfort for the next 4-minutes.\n\nCapping the effort off with a final 30-second surge requires that you dig into what is left of your AC while your body pushes you close to your VO2 max, or the point at which your body is using as much oxygen as it possibly can. The net result is a session that is great for improving FTP, MAP, and AC, regardless of your strengths and weaknesses.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Psychologically**: Each 4-minute segment at just below FTP will end up feeling harder than it should, given your body is forced to stew in whatever excess metabolites you produced in the first 30-seconds. While it will be unpleasant, you should find it never really gets MORE unpleasant. In addition to the benefits from the actual mental training exercises, this preps you to have confidence in your ability to hold longer sustained FTP efforts. The final surge then shows you that even when you feel uncomfortable for that long, your body still has something more to give. Going through the Mental Training techniques while you\u0027re pushing through the discomfort will only make you stronger out on the road.\n\n\u200B\n\nIn some cultures, the bat symbolizes the death of old ways and the rise of new ones. Time to burn those old, bad habits and build some new, positive ones.\n",

              "description": "The goal of this workout is to help develop your baseline aerobic fitness. While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are just times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right!\n\n\u200B\n\nMost people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022 Truth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted. So what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like?\n\nFor 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70% is ok, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm and your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster. You will have to trust us on that one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions! Or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\nWarm-Up\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\nMain Effort\n\nNumber of Sets\n\n5\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set\n\n1\n\nInterval: 10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n\u200B\n\nExtra Volume\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\nCool Down\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

A small country in the Balkan Peninsula that hides some of the most beautiful natural wonders and unique cultural heritage in this part of the world. Yet it remains unknown to many. Only the alternative, curious and brave plan their journeys in this hidden gem. However, a small self-organized crew from Serbia and Germany set a mission to discover and reveal those stunning natural creations of Serbia. On a bicycle. In just five days, they traversed 450 kilometers across six mountains of Western Serbia, and climbed around 11,000 meters to film and produce what you are about to experience.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: The workout accompanying this film is a recovery session. It\u0027s a very low-intensity ride, with your power remaining at or below 50% of FTP (an RPE less than 2.5 on a scale from 1 to 10) and your heart rate in Zone 1. The intensity and cadence targets will vary throughout this session to keep it interesting, but not so much that it distracts you from the story.\n",

              "description": "The goal of this workout is to help develop your baseline aerobic fitness. While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high and your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week. Shorter Endurance rides (like this one) can fit in both a hard week of training and a recovery week. That is, only if you do it right! Most people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022\n\n\u200B\n\nTruth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride, especially one under 90 minutes should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted.\n\nSo what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like? For 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70%, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in low to mid Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can; for most this is 80-90rpm. Also, your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster, but you will have to trust us on this one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions, or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: 2\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nNA\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

Professional triathlete Eric Lagerstrom sets out on a summer of self-discovery across Colorado, Arizona, and British Columbia, reconnecting with the curiosity that first pulled him into the sport.\n\nAlong the way, he rides remote gravel roads with endurance legend Heather Jackson, dives into icy open water with Olympic gold medalist Simon Whitfield, and runs high alpine ridgelines far from any race course. Together, they explore a deeper purpose in sport\u2014one rooted in wonder, not competition.\n\nShot across three breathtaking locations, this is triathlon like you\u2019ve never seen it: wild, creative, and free.\n\nThis is multi-sport without rules.

The intensity and cadence targets will vary throughout this session to keep it interesting (But not so interesting that you can\u0027t pay attention to the film).\n",

However, a small self-organized crew from Serbia and Germany set a mission to discover and reveal those stunning natural creations of Serbia. On a bicycle.

              "description": "This brutal but straightforward workout is perfect for developing both FTP and MAP while teaching you a Negative Split pacing strategy. For this workout, you will complete a series of 4-minute efforts. The first 3-minutes are right at your FTP, which isn\u0027t so tough in itself, but the final 1-minute of each effort are set above 90% of MAP.\n\n\u200B\n\nWhen we talk about a \u0022negative split\u0022 we mean completing the second half of an effort at a higher speed/power than the first half. By the time you hit the MAP portion of each interval, your heart rate and breathing rate will already be nice and high. This limits the AC demand of a standalone MAP effort, where you have a large lag time between producing the power requirement, and your body delivering the oxygen needed to hold that power. Usually, that lag time between oxygen demand and oxygen supply is covered by your AC. Paced correctly, your heart rate should essentially be increasing for the entire 4-minutes, as it will be settling into LTHR right as you up the power output.\n\n\u200B\n\nAs you complete each effort, holding 100% of FTP will feel harder and harder. This in itself is excellent mental practice for \u0022feeling\u0022 how your RPE for the same power can drift up as fatigue sets in. Knowing what 100% of FTP feels like when your legs are nearly spent is a great reminder of why starting an effort too hard will bite you in the end.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis workout ends up delivering a fantastic aerobic workload as you complete 8-minutes of MAP work with minimal help from your AC, making this an excellent session for those who have a strong AC but weak MAP. You also rack up 24-minutes at 100% of FTP, which by itself would be a good training load. Add in these MAP efforts, and you multiply the training impact of those 24-minutes.\n\n\u200B\n\nRegardless of your chosen discipline or event, this is a session that will benefit everyone, both regarding learning good pacing and giving your aerobic system a big training boost.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C85%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C95%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 90% of MAP (105-135% of FTP)\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 2\n\nRest Between Sets: 15 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 4\n\n**Interval**\n\nFTP Effort: 3 minutes @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\nVO2 Effort: 1 minute @ RPE 9 -- 90-95% of MAP (105-130% of FTP) \n\nRecovery: 5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70% \n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n4 minutes @ RPE 1 -- \u003C45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

              "description": "The goal of this workout is to help develop your baseline aerobic fitness. While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are just times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right!\n\n\u200B\n\nMost people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022 Truth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted. So what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like?\n\nFor 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70% is ok, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm and your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster. You will have to trust us on that one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions! Or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\nWarm-Up\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\nMain Effort\n\nNumber of Sets\n\n5\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set\n\n1\n\nInterval: 10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n\u200B\n\nExtra Volume\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\nCool Down\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

The blend between mind and body, working together to overcome hard moments\u2014be it physical, mental or emotional\u2014and how we learn to cope in our own mind is essential in being able to process the past, be true to ourselves in the present, and create moments of inner peace in the future.\n\n\u200B\n\nA decade after crossing the French Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es non-stop on a ride that would act as a catalyst for change, I wanted to share this story for the first time. To give an insight into the deeper meaning behind some of the mountain challenges you may have seen me undertake over the years, I felt now was the time to head back to my mountains, return to source, and embrace the unknown.\n\n\u200B\n\nOvercoming the mountains of our mind, from escapism to reconnection. 10 years, 10 cols and 10,000 meters of climbing. This is my story of going Full Circle.\n\n\u200B\n\nThank you for watching. I truly hope there is something in this video that can help you in your own journey.\n\n\u200B\n\nPeace,\n\nMike Cotty\u0022\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: The workout accompanying this film is a recovery session, which is a very low-intensity ride. It\u0027s so easy that your power remains at or below 50% of FTP or an RPE less than 2.5, and your heart rate stays in zone 1 the entire time. The intensity and cadence targets will vary throughout this session to keep it interesting (But not so interesting that you can\u0027t pay attention to the film).\n",

              "description": "This brutal but straightforward workout is perfect for developing both FTP and MAP while teaching you a Negative Split pacing strategy. For this workout, you will complete a series of 6-minute efforts. The first 4-minutes are right at your FTP, which isn\u0027t so tough in itself, but the final 2-minutes of each effort are set above 90% of MAP.\n\n\u200B\n\nWhen we talk about a \u0022negative split\u0022 we mean completing the second half of an effort at a higher speed/power than the first half. By the time you hit the MAP portion of each interval, your heart rate and breathing rate will already be nice and high. This limits the AC demand of a standalone MAP effort, where you have a large lag time between producing the power requirement, and your body delivering the oxygen needed to hold that power. Usually, that lag time between oxygen demand and oxygen supply is covered by your AC. Paced correctly, your heart rate should essentially be increasing for the entire 6-minutes, as it will be settling into LTHR right as you up the power output.\n\n\u200B\n\nAs you complete each effort, holding 100% of FTP will feel harder and harder. This in itself is excellent mental practice for \u0022feeling\u0022 how your RPE for the same power can drift up as fatigue sets in. Knowing what 100% of FTP feels like when your legs are nearly spent is a great reminder of why starting an effort too hard will bite you in the end.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis workout ends up delivering a fantastic aerobic workload as you complete 12-minutes of MAP work with minimal help from your AC. Making this an excellent session for those who have a strong AC, but weak MAP. You also rack up 24-minutes at 100% of FTP, which by itself would be a good training load. Add in these MAP efforts, and you multiply the training impact of those 24-minutes.\n\n\u200B\n\nRegardless of your chosen discipline or event, this is a session that will benefit everyone, both regarding learning good pacing and giving your aerobic system a big training boost.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR \u003C100\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort** x2\n\nNumber of sets:\n\nRest between sets: 30 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nInterval repeats per set: 3\n\n**Interval**\n\nEffort 1: 4 minutes @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\nEffort 2: 2 minutes @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\nRest: 5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n50 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minute @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR \u003C70%\n",

              "description": "The goal of this workout is to help develop your baseline aerobic fitness. While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high and your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week. Shorter Endurance rides (like this one) can fit in both a hard week of training and a recovery week. That is, only if you do it right! Most people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022\n\n\u200B\n\nTruth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride, especially one under 90 minutes should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted.\n\nSo what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like? For 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70%, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in low to mid Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can; for most this is 80-90rpm. Also, your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster, but you will have to trust us on this one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions, or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: 4\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nNA\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

It explores extraordinary personal stories of ordinary cyclists taking on iconic endurance event Chase The Sun, revealing the power of the humble bicycle to transform lives and help save the planet.\n\nThe film features contributions from broadcaster and ITV\u2019s voice of the Tour de France Ned Boulting, author and blogger Jools Walker, Turner Prize-winning artist Sir Richard Long and 4x Mountain Bike World Champion Tracy Moseley.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: the workout accompanying this film varies from endurance to tempo to sub-threshold. The higher intensity efforts aren\u0027t the hardest you\u0027ll experience so that you can keep your attention on the film, however, they are just hard enough to help improve your FTP, oxygen utilization efficiency, and the ability to recover quickly between hard efforts. The workout intensity reflects the intensity of the riders in many places, so you may feel as if you\u0027re climbing Mont Ventoux or that you\u0027re a part of Cav\u0027s lead-out train on the run into the finish line.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s how to turn off on-screen graphics for the best viewing experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterInspiration)\n",

After all, your LT pace is one that you can hold for about an hour, so running at that pace for only 5 minutes is going to feel too easy...and you don\u0027t like easy...so make a commitment to stay true to the intensity target that is prescribed.\n\n\u200B\n\nSome reasons for doing short threshold intensity efforts are: to improve recovery time and the ability to repeat the effort after a short rest period, and to do quality work efforts without generating a lot of fatigue that requires significant recovery.\n\n\u200B\n\nFor help understanding your run workout and calculating your pace zones, please see [this article](https://wahoosystm.com/RunningSessionFAQ).\n\nLearn how to perform your [**Running Drills**](https://support.wahoofitness.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404080091922-Running-Drills) here.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warmup**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 2-3 -- 145% of RTP -- HR \u003C70% (Z1-2)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Activation**\n\n2 x 100m accelerations with 1 minute recovery (jog or walk back to start) in between\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 4\n\nInterval Duration: 5 minutes\n\nInterval Intensity: 10k pace (RPE 6.5-7 -- 100-110% of RTP -- HR 95-100%) (Z4a)\n\nRecovery duration and intensity: 3 minutes @ RPE 2-4 -- 120-145% of RTP -- HR 70-87% (Z2)\n\nWhen you can no longer keep the pace, the workout is over.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n3-5 minutes @ RPE 2-3 -- 145% of RTP -- HR \u003C70% (Z1-2)\n",

However, that accumulated time is split up over two sets of 5 efforts, each 2-minutes in length. The goal of this session is to accumulate a significant amount of time near VO2max, or the point at which your body is consuming as much oxygen as it possibly can. That means your heart rate and breathing rate will both be near their max by the end of the 4th and 5th interval in each set.\n\n\u200B\n\nSince it takes time for your heart rate and breathing rate to match your effort, for the first part of each interval, you will be taping into your Anaerobic Capacity to produce the required power. Limited recovery ensures that your Anaerobic Capacity is drained before the end of either set, forcing your body to produce as much power as possible aerobically. By splitting these efforts into two sets, you will be producing more power anaerobically compared to doing all ten intervals in a single set. While this means you accumulate less time near your VO2max, you will be able to hold a higher power for the final five intervals. Splitting the efforts will shift the training stress away from your cardiovascular system and onto your muscular system.\n\nUltimately this session will improve your ability to produce power aerobically in addition to improving your muscular strength and endurance, both of which are key to increasing your MAP and your FTP.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR \u003C70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 150% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n5minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of sets: 2\n\nRest between sets: 20 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nInterval repeats per set: 5\n\n**Interval**\n\nWork: 2 minutes @ RPE 9 -- 95-105%% of MAP (115-135% of FTP)\n\nRest: 2 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n30 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR \u003C70%\n",

              "description": "The goal of this workout is to help develop your baseline aerobic fitness. While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are just times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right!\n\n\u200B\n\nMost people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022 Truth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted. So what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like?\n\nFor 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70% is ok, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm and your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster. You will have to trust us on that one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions! Or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\nWarm-Up\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\nMain Effort\n\nNumber of Sets\n\n5\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set\n\n1\n\nInterval: 10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n\u200B\n\nExtra Volume\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\nCool Down\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

Made This presented by Wahoo \u002B MAAP is a series of behind-the-scenes, unfiltered front-row access with women\u0027s pro cycling team Lifeplus - Wahoo:\n\n1. **Sisterhood: **Dedication, challenges, commitment, belief, family and sisterhood are all components of what it takes to be a professional racing team. In the first of a series of behind-the-scenes, unfiltered front-row access with team Lifeplus-Wahoo, MADE THIS is a collection of short films from MAAP Pro Team Racing that reveals what it takes to make a champion a champion.\n2. **Prepared for anything: **The excitement of Holy Week at the Tour de Flanders is upon us, and Team Lifeplus-Wahoo is gearing up for a challenging ride. With 163km to conquer, featuring 12 climbs and seven cobbled stretches, not to mention seven slippery flat stone sections\u2014all under a deluge of rain\u2014anything could happen.\n3. **Passion on the cobbles: **Join us as we dive deep into the chaotic and exhilarating world of the Paris-Roubaix, one of cycling\u0027s most grueling races. Amidst the cobblestones and mud, Team Lifeplus-Wahoo faces the ultimate test of endurance and skill. With a new lineup and high stakes, the team navigates the unpredictable nature of this legendary race, where luck can play a huge role and every second counts.\n4. **Home sweet home: **After a fallow year for the tour, the team are eager to push for results in front of an expectant crowd. But instead of the warm welcome on familiar roads, disaster strikes the first morning of the race. As national news of the unfortunate event breaks, the team are left wondering if they\u0027ll be able to compete or if this becomes a home visit to forget. What follows is a true act of human kindness and a gesture that symbolises the unifying bond of the women\u0027s pro peloton.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: The workout accompanying this film is a recovery session. It\u0027s a very low-intensity ride, with your power remaining at or below 50% of FTP (an RPE less than 2.5 on a scale from 1 to 10) and your heart rate in Zone 1. The intensity and cadence targets will vary throughout this session to keep it interesting, but not so much that it distracts you from the story.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s how to turn off on-screen graphics for the best viewing experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterInspiration)\n",

This one, however is a little less focused on Anaerobic Capacity and a little more on muscle endurance, due to that big blue block in the middle. The first pyramid will begin to fatigue your muscles and tax your AC before you face 20 minutes at tempo. With both of those efforts under your belt, the second pyramid will drain the rest of your AC and ask your aerobic system to pick up the slack. This might even feel similar to a mountain bike or cyclocross race effort- you take it out hard, jockeying for the hole shot or a front pack position before getting into the technical elements. Then you settle into a sustainable effort for a short while, maybe working with a couple others before battling it out for your final finishing position.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n9 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4 -- 70% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n**Build x3**\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n1 minute 30 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of sets: 2\n\nRest between sets: 20 minutes @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR \u003C100\n\nInterval repeats per set: 1\n\n**Interval **\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 200% of FTP -- \u003E105%\n\n50 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 9.5 -- 180% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n40 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 150% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n40 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n50 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n50 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n40 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 150% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 9.5 -- 180% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n40 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 200% of FTP -- \u003E105%\n\n7 minutes 30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume **\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down **\n\n10 minutes 40 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n",

              "description": "The goal of this workout is to help develop your baseline aerobic fitness. While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are just times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right!\n\n\u200B\n\nMost people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022 Truth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted. So what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like?\n\nFor 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70% is ok, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm and your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster. You will have to trust us on that one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions! Or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\nWarm-Up\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\nMain Effort\n\nNumber of Sets\n\n5\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set\n\n1\n\nInterval: 10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n\u200B\n\nExtra Volume\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\nCool Down\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

Made This presented by Wahoo \u002B MAAP is a series of behind-the-scenes, unfiltered front-row access with women\u0027s pro cycling team Lifeplus - Wahoo:\n\n1. **Sisterhood: **Dedication, challenges, commitment, belief, family and sisterhood are all components of what it takes to be a professional racing team. In the first of a series of behind-the-scenes, unfiltered front-row access with team Lifeplus-Wahoo, MADE THIS is a collection of short films from MAAP Pro Team Racing that reveals what it takes to make a champion a champion.\n2. **Prepared for anything: **The excitement of Holy Week at the Tour de Flanders is upon us, and Team Lifeplus-Wahoo is gearing up for a challenging ride. With 163km to conquer, featuring 12 climbs and seven cobbled stretches, not to mention seven slippery flat stone sections\u2014all under a deluge of rain\u2014anything could happen.\n3. **Passion on the cobbles: **Join us as we dive deep into the chaotic and exhilarating world of the Paris-Roubaix, one of cycling\u0027s most grueling races. Amidst the cobblestones and mud, Team Lifeplus-Wahoo faces the ultimate test of endurance and skill. With a new lineup and high stakes, the team navigates the unpredictable nature of this legendary race, where luck can play a huge role and every second counts.\n4. **Home sweet home: **After a fallow year for the tour, the team are eager to push for results in front of an expectant crowd. But instead of the warm welcome on familiar roads, disaster strikes the first morning of the race. As national news of the unfortunate event breaks, the team are left wondering if they\u0027ll be able to compete or if this becomes a home visit to forget. What follows is a true act of human kindness and a gesture that symbolises the unifying bond of the women\u0027s pro peloton.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: The workout accompanying this film is a recovery session. It\u0027s a very low-intensity ride, with your power remaining at or below 50% of FTP (an RPE less than 2.5 on a scale from 1 to 10) and your heart rate in Zone 1. The intensity and cadence targets will vary throughout this session to keep it interesting, but not so much that it distracts you from the story.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s how to turn off on-screen graphics for the best viewing experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterInspiration)\n",

While it\u0027s not as comprehensive or as accurate as our main fitness test, _Full Frontal_, it\u0027s far more approachable and easier to pace for new riders. It also doesn\u0027t require any special preparation. You just need to feel relatively fresh.\n\n\u200B\n\nBased on more than a year of research (and after dozens of lab tests and thousands of online tests) and using sophisticated analysis of power and heart rate data, _Half Monty_ is far more accurate and comprehensive than standard ramp tests.\n\n\u200B\n\nIt also tells you more about who you are as an athlete. _Half Monty_ provides you with your FTP, Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP), and Cycling Threshold Heart Rate (cTHR), all of which we use to personalize your workout targets.\n\n\u200B\n\nIf you\u0027re still using the 4DP estimates when you set up your account, _Half Monty_ will also refine your AC and NM estimates (but will not do so if you\u0027ve done _Full Frontal_ or manually adjusted your estimates). If you want fully accurate AC and NM, as well as your Rider Type, Strengths, Weaknesses, and training plans adjusted to those Strengths and Weaknesses, you\u0027ll need to expose yourself to the _Full Frontal_ 4DP fitness test.\n\n\u200B\n\nReady to climb the ramp? You\u0027ll need the following before you start:\n\n- A heart rate monitor if you want the most accurate results. Don\u0027t have one? Order one [HERE](https://wahoofitness.com/devices)\n- Some kind of power device connected (trainer, power meter, virtual power, etc.)\n- Be ready to pay close attention to the instructions in the workout\n- Be sure your profile is complete and up-to-date (Profile \u003E About You). Accurate information helps us make our calculations\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to \u0027[Why Fitness Testing Matters](https://the-knowledge-by-wahoo-sports-science.simplecast.com/episodes/testing-testing-1-2-3-why-fitness-testing-matters)\u0027 on The Knowledge Podcast by Wahoo Sports Science.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s some more information on how to get the most from your fitness test.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterFitnessAssessment)\n",

              "description": "The 3x25-minute sub-threshold workout is one of the most classic interval sessions out there, so prepare for a trip to the northern Painlands for this FTP-builder. The reason the 3x25 sub-threshold workout is so popular is that it is easy to follow, helps teach good pacing, and gives you a great threshold training stimulus.\n\n\u200B\n\nIn this case, you\u0027re looking at three, (roughly) 25-minute blocks at around 90% of your FTP, an effort we refer to as \u0022Sub-Threshold\u0022. Many refer to this intensity as \u0022Sweet-Spot\u0022, but we prefer Sub-Threshold, as the real key is to never let your power creep above your FTP. Staying just below threshold ensures that your effort remains at an intensity you know your body can handle but that is close to what would not be sustainable.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe only way you\u0027re going to make it through three of these efforts is if you pace yourself properly. Everyone feels just fine for the first 5 minutes of the first effort, and are often tempted to go harder. Don\u0027t be that person. More often than not, that person blows up spectacularly in the second interval, unable to finish the session. Or they have to ride that second interval at lower power, turning it into a Tempo session, which is not the goal.\n\n\u200B\n\nGetting a sense of how these efforts \u0022bite\u0022 towards the end is vital to learning how to pace yourself over longer steady-state efforts; whether that\u0027s a time trial, local climb, breakaway, triathlon, or even a good old fitness test. In each of those cases, the pacing is key. Learning how your perceived effort can steadily climb even though your power remains unchanged is critical to good pacing.\n\n\u200B\n\nSo how do you know if you are doing this one right? As we said, the first 5 minutes should feel relatively easy. Around that 5-minute mark, your heart rate should stop climbing, and settle into 2-5% below your Lactate Threshold Heart Rate (LTHR). If your heart rate is climbing for the entire effort and goes above your LTHR, then you are going too hard.\n\nIf you hit the 10-minute mark, your legs feel fine, and your heart rate is still in Zone 3, then you aren\u0027t going hard enough.\n\nIf you\u0027ve never done a session like this before, you can consider only doing the first 20-minute effort, or even sticking to just the first 15 minutes of each effort. There\u0027s no shame in building up to this full session, so don\u0027t be afraid to pause and fast forward as needed.\n\n\u200B\n\nNailing this session is really about getting in tune with your body and understanding what the edge between a sustainable and an unsustainable effort feels like. Not being able to complete this workout is fairly common, so don\u0027t beat yourself up if you can\u0027t make it through the first few times. As long as you come away from this session with a better understanding of how to pace longer efforts, you\u0027ve improved as an athlete.\n",

              "description": "The goal of this workout is to help develop your baseline aerobic fitness. While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are just times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right!\n\n\u200B\n\nMost people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022 Truth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted. So what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like?\n\nFor 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70% is ok, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm and your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster. You will have to trust us on that one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions! Or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\nWarm-Up\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\nMain Effort\n\nNumber of Sets\n\n5\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set\n\n1\n\nInterval: 10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n\u200B\n\nExtra Volume\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\nCool Down\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

To win requires riding almost non-stop, night and day, for days on end. It\u0027s a combination of strength and sleep deprivation that only a few riders in the world can manage. Alone, unsupported and loaded down with supplies, each competitor must constantly battle mechanicals, heat exhaustion and saddle sores to get to the finish. There is no prize, no money, simply the satisfaction that comes from pushing oneself to the limit while exploring the forgotten corners of a beautiful country. With support from PEdALED, Canyon, Fizik and the race crew led by organiser and route creator Nelson Trees, filmmaker Brady Lawrence followed the race documenting everything from a brutal 80 kilometre walk through the high desert with a broken bike, to one racer\u2019s simple joy at realising they\u2019ll soon eat their first warm meal in days. Featuring the sport\u2019s biggest names and first-time, ultra- distance racers alike, the film gets up close to the kind of people crazy enough to take on this epic challenge. Capturing the human drama set against an otherworldly landscape, Into the Rift is an in-depth look at a true cycling adventure.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4Workout: This is a great way to watch a compelling documentary while developing your baseline aerobic fitness.

You\u0027ve just come off the Tour de France, where you set up your team\u0027s sprinter, Caleb Ewan, for three stage wins. All eyes on you to deliver another big result. But with the accumulated fatigue of back-to-back days of racing, there\u0027s some question as to whether your team can deliver the goods. Jump into the action for 53km of fast and furious racing through the streets of London to see if you can help pull off another win.\n\n\u200B\n\n**About ProRides**\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever dreamed of being a professional cyclist, now\u2019s your chance. The SYSTM ProRide series allows you to experience what it\u2019s like to be in the biggest bike races in the world, thanks to the SYSTM 4DP\u00AE platform. We\u2019ve taken the first-person camera footage and power data from a pro cyclist and analyzed it to determine which part of their 4DP\u00AE profile each of their efforts corresponds to. But since few of us can put down pro-level watts, we made it so all of the efforts are scaled to your own personal 4DP\u00AE profile. That means you get to experience exactly what the pros experience relative to your own abilities. When they sprint, you sprint. When they attack, you attack. When they sit up, you get to take it (relatively) easy. It\u0027s the most immersive, realistic race simulation out there.\n\n\u200B\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s some more information on how to create the most immersive ProRides experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterProRides)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Featured Footage: **Velon\n",

              "description": "This is a technique-focused session designed to develop your agility, stability, range of motion, and foot speed. There is no focus on heart rate zones so you may choose to leave your monitor at home for these sessions. Between sets of each drill, you should jog/walk easily to fully recover between the efforts. While these efforts shouldn\u2019t be too taxing on you, the key is perfect form, so you want to be hitting each one rested enough that you can maintain great form for the duration. You should take a bit of extra rest between techniques, again to ensure you are rested and can nail the form. Before starting the workout, familiarize yourself with the format for high knees, butt kicks, skipping, carioca and strides. Find a flat track, field, or 50-100m of open space to perform this workout (football and soccer fields are great for this).\n\n\u200B\n\nFor help understanding your run workout and calculating your pace zones, please see [this article](https://wahoosystm.com/RunningSessionFAQ).\n\nLearn how to perform your [**Running Drills**](https://support.wahoofitness.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404080091922-Running-Drills) here.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-up:**\n\nStart off with 5-10 minutes of easy jogging/walking.\n\nHigh Knees: 2-3 sets of 50m high knees.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- Take short strides, bringing your knees up high enough that your upper legs are parallel to the ground. Focus on achieving high knees AND quick turnover, or performing as many reps as possible in a short distance.\n\n**Butt Kicks:**\n\n2-3 sets of 50m butt kicks.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- This should actually look similar to a high knee drill, but with the heels coming up to touch the bottom of your butt. Take short strides while using your hamstrings to lift your heels up beneath your butt. Your knees should come up in front of your body while pulling your heels up beneath your hips, rather than keeping your quads and knees below and in line with your hips.\n\n**Skipping:**\n\n3-4 sets of 50m skipping.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- Focus on a high knee drive and swinging your arms at your sides like you would when running.\n\n**Carioca:**\n\n4 sets of 30m Carioca in each direction (8 total).\n\nRest for 20 seconds between direction changes (at your discretion).\n\n- For this drill, you need to face sidewise to the direction you want to go. Start off moving to the right. Bring your left knee up and across your body and put your left foot in front of your right foot. Step your right foot to the right so it is parallel with your left leg again (at this point you should be positioned in the same direction and orientation that you were at the start. Next step your left leg behind your right leg, again so it lands on the right side of your right leg. Then bring your right leg back across your body, once again ending up in the starting position. Repeat this pattern for 25-30m.\n\n**Strides:**\n\n2-3 sets of 60m; Gradually build effort from RPE 3-8.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between. These are comprised of a steady acceleration over 60-80m up to 5k pace. The goal is to increase speed after each step, so you are reaching maximum speed at the end of the 60-80m stretch. You want to focus on keeping your shoulders, neck, and jaw relaxed while maintaining strong knee drive, straight and compact arm swing, planting the feet beneath the hips, and fast turnover.\n\n\u200B\n\nHigh Knees \u002B Butt Kicks:\n\nFinish these drills with one set each of 50m high knees and butt kicks.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool-down:**\n\nWalk or jog for 5 minutes to cool down.\n\nIn case you need to brush up on your running [drills](https://wahoosystm.com/RunningSessionFAQ)\n",

The then-26-year-old Belgian was taken to hospital with serious head injuries, including a fractured skull and bleeding on the brain, and was in a coma for months. At the time doctors feared he may never regain consciousness.\n\n\u200B\n\nStig\u0027s story is a universal story of the bad luck of one young man and his endless perseverance and positivity to overcome. It\u2019s a story of unconditional love from his family and friends. It\u2019s a story of hope and even though many of us won\u2019t face something as severe as Stig, we all struggle with life sometimes. There is a lesson in Stig\u2019s contagious smile for all of us.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, riding to this Inspiration film is a great way to watch an interesting film while developing your baseline aerobic fitness. The intensity of this workout will vary mostly between 60-70% of FTP, with heart rate remaining entirely in zone 2. This session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s how to turn off on-screen graphics for the best viewing experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterInspiration)\n",

              "description": "The goal of this workout is to help develop your baseline aerobic fitness. While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high and your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week. Shorter Endurance rides (like this one) can fit in both a hard week of training and a recovery week. That is, only if you do it right! Most people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022\n\n\u200B\n\nTruth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride, especially one under 90 minutes should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted.\n\nSo what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like? For 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70%, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in low to mid Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can; for most this is 80-90rpm. Also, your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster, but you will have to trust us on this one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions, or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: 2\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nNA\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

This journey, in many ways, parallels the experiences of numerous individuals. Why do we need this kind of riding? Why do we crave this adventure? Rather than providing a generic answer, the film delves into Manu\u2019s relationship with cycling as a tool for freedom, exploration, meditation, and perhaps even therapy in some ways. The film unfolds in the Kirghiz mountains during the Silk Road Mountain Race in 2023, where Manu crashed and had to scratch. It then retraces its steps back in time and travels to other lands. Initially, the film was intended to be a video race recap, but it evolved into a love letter to freedom and movement. Eventually, it underwent another transformation, and Scratches is the result of a constantly evolving process in that regard.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: This is a great way to watch a compelling documentary while developing your baseline aerobic fitness.

We\u2019ve taken the first-person camera footage and power data from a pro cyclist and analyzed it to determine which part of their 4DP\u00AE profile each of their efforts corresponds to. But since few of us can put down pro-level watts, we made it so all of the efforts are scaled to your own personal 4DP\u00AE profile. That means you get to experience exactly what the pros experience relative to your own abilities. When they sprint, you sprint. When they attack, you attack. When they sit up, you get to take it (relatively) easy.

While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high and your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week. Shorter Endurance rides (like this one) can fit in both a hard week of training and a recovery week. That is, only if you do it right! Most people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022\n\n\u200B\n\nTruth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride, especially one under 90 minutes should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted.\n\nSo what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like? For 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70%, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in low to mid Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can; for most this is 80-90rpm. Also, your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster, but you will have to trust us on this one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions, or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: 4\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nNA\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

The first, male American to win the Tour de France, LeMond came back from the brink of death to beat his famed rivals in the historic and nail-biting race at the 1989 Tour de France.\n\nDirected by Alex Holmes and featuring exclusive interviews with LeMond and his wife Kathy as well as, never before seen footage, The Last Rider is an exhilarating portrait of one of the greatest athletes of our time.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: the workout accompanying this film varies from endurance to tempo to sub-threshold. The higher intensity efforts aren\u0027t the hardest you\u0027ll experience so that you can keep your attention on the film, however, they are just hard enough to help improve your FTP, oxygen utilization efficiency, and the ability to recover quickly between hard efforts. The workout intensity reflects the intensity of the riders in many places, so you may feel as if you\u0027re climbing Mont Ventoux or that you\u0027re a part of Cav\u0027s lead-out train on the run into the finish line.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s how to turn off on-screen graphics for the best viewing experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterInspiration)\n",

Only the alternative, curious and brave plan their journeys in this hidden gem. However, a small self-organized crew from Serbia and Germany set a mission to discover and reveal those stunning natural creations of Serbia. On a bicycle. In just five days, they traversed 450 kilometers across six mountains of Western Serbia, and climbed around 11,000 meters to film and produce what you are about to experience.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: The workout accompanying this film is a recovery session.

We\u2019ve taken the first-person camera footage and power data from a pro cyclist and analyzed it to determine which part of their 4DP\u00AE profile each of their efforts corresponds to. But since few of us can put down pro-level watts, we made it so all of the efforts are scaled to your own personal 4DP\u00AE profile. That means you get to experience exactly what the pros experience relative to your own abilities. When they sprint, you sprint. When they attack, you attack. When they sit up, you get to take it (relatively) easy. It\u0027s the most immersive, realistic race simulation out there.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s some more information on how to create the most immersive ProRides experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterProRides)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Featured Footage: **Velon\n",

              "description": "The goal of this workout is to help develop your baseline aerobic fitness. While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high and your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week. Shorter Endurance rides (like this one) can fit in both a hard week of training and a recovery week. That is, only if you do it right! Most people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022\n\n\u200B\n\nTruth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride, especially one under 90 minutes should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted.\n\nSo what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like? For 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70%, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in low to mid Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can; for most this is 80-90rpm. Also, your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster, but you will have to trust us on this one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions, or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: 4\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nNA\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

              "description": "The goal of this workout is to help develop your baseline aerobic fitness. While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are just times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right! Most people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022\n\n\u200B\n\nTruth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted. So what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like? For 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70% is ok, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm. Also, your RPE should be a 2-4.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster. You will have to trust us on that one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions! Or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 7\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 1\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C85%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

The term \u0022Taper\u0022 refers to how you train in the week or so before your target event to ensure you deliver your best performance. Generally, tapering means reducing your total training volume but continuing to hit some high-intensity efforts. While there are individual variations in the best way to taper, this session has been used by countless professionals leading into the biggest races of their lives -- athletes like World Champions Rohan Dennis and Flora Duffy.\n\n\u200B\n\nWith 3 sets of micro-intervals (40/20s, 30/30s, and 20/40s) you will hit your system with just enough intensity to keep your legs sharp and responsive, without adding any real fatigue. Outside of those 3 sets of micro-intervals, this session is purposefully short and easy. This is a preparation session, not a training session! After all, your event is just around the corner and all of the important training is behind you. Riding harder or longer today will do absolutely nothing to increase your fitness by event day; in fact, all that would do is increase your fatigue, which will only hurt your performance. Rather, this session makes sure your body is humming along and ready to perform on the big day.\n",

However, a small self-organized crew from Serbia and Germany set a mission to discover and reveal those stunning natural creations of Serbia. On a bicycle. In just five days, they traversed 450 kilometers across six mountains of Western Serbia, and climbed around 11,000 meters to film and produce what you are about to experience.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: This is a great way to watch a compelling documentary while developing your baseline aerobic fitness.

A recovery spin is a very low intensity ride, so easy that you\u2019d feel embarrassed to ride so slowly if you didn\u2019t know you were helping your body get so much faster.\n\n\u200B\n\nA good recovery spin is done at a cadence above 90 RPM. While keeping power below 50% of FTP, or an RPE less than 2.5, and keeping your heart rate in Zone 1 the entire time. Recovery spins can be done outdoors, but due to the low power demands, they are often easier done on the trainer. Resist the voice of your inner Sufferlandrian telling you to go faster.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Set**\n\n30 minute @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR \u003C70%\n",

              "description": "This is a technique-focused session designed to develop your agility, stability, range of motion, and foot speed. There is no focus on heart rate zones so you may choose to leave your monitor at home for these sessions. Between sets of each drill, you should jog/walk easily to fully recover between the efforts. While these efforts shouldn\u2019t be too taxing on you, the key is perfect form, so you want to be hitting each one rested enough that you can maintain great form for the duration. You should take a bit of extra rest between techniques, again to ensure you are rested and can nail the form. Before starting the workout, familiarize yourself with the format for high knees, butt kicks, skipping, carioca and strides. Find a flat track, field, or 50-100m of open space to perform this workout (football and soccer fields are great for this).\n\n\u200B\n\nFor help understanding your run workout and calculating your pace zones, please see [this article](https://wahoosystm.com/RunningSessionFAQ).\n\nLearn how to perform your [**Running Drills**](https://support.wahoofitness.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404080091922-Running-Drills) here.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-up:**\n\nStart off with 5-10 minutes of easy jogging/walking.\n\nHigh Knees: 2-3 sets of 50m high knees.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- Take short strides, bringing your knees up high enough that your upper legs are parallel to the ground. Focus on achieving high knees AND quick turnover, or performing as many reps as possible in a short distance.\n\n**Butt Kicks:**\n\n2-3 sets of 50m butt kicks.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- This should actually look similar to a high knee drill, but with the heels coming up to touch the bottom of your butt. Take short strides while using your hamstrings to lift your heels up beneath your butt. Your knees should come up in front of your body while pulling your heels up beneath your hips, rather than keeping your quads and knees below and in line with your hips.\n\n**Skipping:**\n\n3-4 sets of 50m skipping.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- Focus on a high knee drive and swinging your arms at your sides like you would when running.\n\n**Carioca:**\n\n4 sets of 30m Carioca in each direction (8 total).\n\nRest for 20 seconds between direction changes (at your discretion).\n\n- For this drill, you need to face sidewise to the direction you want to go. Start off moving to the right. Bring your left knee up and across your body and put your left foot in front of your right foot. Step your right foot to the right so it is parallel with your left leg again (at this point you should be positioned in the same direction and orientation that you were at the start. Next step your left leg behind your right leg, again so it lands on the right side of your right leg. Then bring your right leg back across your body, once again ending up in the starting position. Repeat this pattern for 25-30m.\n\n**Strides:**\n\n2-3 sets of 60m; Gradually build effort from RPE 3-8.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between. These are comprised of a steady acceleration over 60-80m up to 5k pace. The goal is to increase speed after each step, so you are reaching maximum speed at the end of the 60-80m stretch. You want to focus on keeping your shoulders, neck, and jaw relaxed while maintaining strong knee drive, straight and compact arm swing, planting the feet beneath the hips, and fast turnover.\n\n\u200B\n\nHigh Knees \u002B Butt Kicks:\n\nFinish these drills with one set each of 50m high knees and butt kicks.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool-down:**\n\nWalk or jog for 5 minutes to cool down.\n\nIn case you need to brush up on your running [drills](https://wahoosystm.com/RunningSessionFAQ)\n",

It will help you re-focus, reset, and reestablish your confidence in who you are and where you\u2019re headed.\n\n\u200B\n\n**GET THE WORKBOOK**\n\nIf you haven\u0027t yet, download the [Mental Training Workbook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11VIC1ZmuIwDpmv9xdeUrZ6NJ_nZraqPv/view?usp=sharing).\n\nIt\u0027s a fillable PDF, but you can print it if you prefer to work from a hard copy.\n",

Some of these moves may seem very basic but we encourage you to focus on perfect form and execution during these early levels so that when we turn up the heat you have things nailed. As you\u0027ll see, all the exercises at the lower levels will progress in a similar fashion going forward. We\u0027re building strength, but also fine-tuning your nervous system. As the program progresses you\u0027ll be asked to complete more difficult variations on each foundational move.\n\n\u200B\n\nAs with all the strength training routines, it helps if you\u2019ve done a warm-up before getting started. That can be one of your favorite yoga routines, riding your bike on the trainer for 5-10 minutes, or doing a personal stretching routine.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?

This includes everything from your powerful glutes, hamstrings, and calves to the postural muscles of your upper back and neck._\n\n\u200B\n\nYour posterior chain is responsible for back and hip extension as well as knee flexion. It is vital in maintaining optimal posture during cycling and running in addition to water position in swimming. In this first session, we introduce some basic movements that focus on the activation and stabilization of posterior chain muscles. These moves include a combination of eccentric (lengthening), concentric (shortening), and isometric (holding) contractions. They provide your body with the foundation for more demanding moves to come. This is also a good session to come back to if you feel like you could use a quick posterior chain activation or tune-up.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?

The goal is not to develop big muscles in your arms and chest, but to build basic functional strength to help you improve stability and become a more well-rounded athlete.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis extra work is derived from more difficult variations of the foundation moves. While the added upper-body component will decrease the number of reps you can complete in a set, your primary goal remains to nail perfect form. Even though you\u0027ve been at this for several weeks your nervous system is still learning these movement patterns.

It is vital in maintaining optimal posture during cycling and running in addition to water position in swimming. In this first session, we introduce some basic movements that focus on the activation and stabilization of posterior chain muscles. These moves include a combination of eccentric (lengthening), concentric (shortening), and isometric (holding) contractions. They provide your body with the foundation for more demanding moves to come.

It is vital in maintaining optimal posture during cycling and running in addition to water position in swimming. In this first session, we introduce some basic movements that focus on the activation and stabilization of posterior chain muscles. These moves include a combination of eccentric (lengthening), concentric (shortening), and isometric (holding) contractions. They provide your body with the foundation for more demanding moves to come. This is also a good session to come back to if you feel like you could use a quick posterior chain activation or tune-up.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?

It introduces the most basic versions of moves that make up the majority of this program. Some of these moves may seem very basic but we encourage you to focus on perfect form and execution during these early levels so that when we turn up the heat you have things nailed. As you\u0027ll see, all the exercises at the lower levels will progress in a similar fashion going forward. We\u0027re building strength, but also fine-tuning your nervous system. As the program progresses you\u0027ll be asked to complete more difficult variations on each foundational move.\n\n\u200B\n\nAs with all the strength training routines, it helps if you\u2019ve done a warm-up before getting started. That can be one of your favorite yoga routines, riding your bike on the trainer for 5-10 minutes, or doing a personal stretching routine.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?

It introduces the most basic versions of moves that make up the majority of this program. Some of these moves may seem very basic but we encourage you to focus on perfect form and execution during these early levels so that when we turn up the heat you have things nailed. As you\u0027ll see, all the exercises at the lower levels will progress in a similar fashion going forward. We\u0027re building strength, but also fine-tuning your nervous system.

Our Full Body Strength series is exactly what you\u2019re after, offering a well-rounded series of exercises that covers the lower body, core, posterior chain, and upper body. With a substantial progression, there\u2019s enough here to keep you busy -- and improving -- for a very long time._\n\n\u200B\n\nThis is the first routine in the Full Body series. It introduces the most basic versions of moves that make up the majority of this program. Some of these moves may seem very basic but we encourage you to focus on perfect form and execution during these early levels so that when we turn up the heat you have things nailed. As you\u0027ll see, all the exercises at the lower levels will progress in a similar fashion going forward. We\u0027re building strength, but also fine-tuning your nervous system. As the program progresses you\u0027ll be asked to complete more difficult variations on each foundational move.\n\n\u200B\n\nAs with all the strength training routines, it helps if you\u2019ve done a warm-up before getting started. That can be one of your favorite yoga routines, riding your bike on the trainer for 5-10 minutes, or doing a personal stretching routine.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?

It introduces the most basic versions of moves that make up the majority of this program. Some of these moves may seem very basic but we encourage you to focus on perfect form and execution during these early levels so that when we turn up the heat you have things nailed. As you\u0027ll see, all the exercises at the lower levels will progress in a similar fashion going forward. We\u0027re building strength, but also fine-tuning your nervous system. As the program progresses you\u0027ll be asked to complete more difficult variations on each foundational move.\n\n\u200B\n\nAs with all the strength training routines, it helps if you\u2019ve done a warm-up before getting started. That can be one of your favorite yoga routines, riding your bike on the trainer for 5-10 minutes, or doing a personal stretching routine.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?
