As you become familiar with the routine, you can begin to focus on synchronizing your breath with your movements, aiming to use nasal breathing as much as possible. It is an excellent practice for the morning to warm up and improve focus, or it can be done directly after a workout to help prevent extreme muscle stiffness.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe objectives are to improve mobility in the spine and hips, stretch the calves, hamstrings, hip flexors, and lower back, practice synchronizing breath and movement, and potentially alleviate lower back pain.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Poses in this session:**\n\n- Mountain\n- Half Sun Salutations\n- Downward Dog\n- Crescent Lunge\n- Bridge\n- Reclining Spinal Twist\n- Final Resting Pose\n",
