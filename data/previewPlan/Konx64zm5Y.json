Intervals get harder as they get shorter, pushing your Anaerobic Capacity (AC) to the very limit and ensuring that after each micro-interval, your body recovers just enough to hit and hold your power target for the next interval...even if you don\u0027t think you can.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe 5 and 10-second efforts hit your Neuromuscular (NM) system hard. No holding back for these short efforts. All out means all out. The 15-60 second efforts all require significant anaerobic energy, but with so little rest, your cardiovascular system never really gets a break. This not only stresses your AC as you try to recover, but it also pushes your Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) to its limit as your body tries to generate as much aerobic power as possible.\n\n\u200B\n\nEven though there is no single interval in this workout that is longer than 60 seconds, each full set lasts more than 20 minutes, so the unrelenting aerobic stress turns this session into a surprisingly good FTP builder.\n",

And while most of the climb is actually at tempo and sub-threshold effort, there are enough surges above it that your body will constantly be responding to them to clear out those nasty metabolites. Painsuckers, rejoice!\n\n\u200B\n\nContrary to popular belief, there are greater improvements that can be made in your FTP by working below FTP than there are in working above it. Also, during such a long effort with limited recovery the seemingly lower intensity is actually quite challenging. That\u2019s one of the reasons why the same power target five minutes into this climb feels much harder when it comes again at minute 30. This is a great session to help you work on your ability to maintain concentration and form even when fatigued\u2026so load this one up and climb your way to greater fitness and performance!\n",

The first set of sprints has enough recovery that you\u0027ll be able to work your NM to the max. The second set still has enough recovery to allow you to hit high power numbers, but the reduced time between sprints stresses your ability to recover and repeat that high effort. That means you\u0027ll start to dip into AC. The last set\u2014with equal sprint and recovery times\u2014ensures your heart rate never gets a chance to drop down.

Both sets of intervals are designed to have equal work to rest ratios, so the longer intervals have longer recovery time afterward. This first set will begin to deplete your Anaerobic Capacity (AC), and by the end, your aerobic system will have to work overtime to help keep the power up. And keep the power up you will, since as the intervals get shorter they also get harder.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe second interval set follows the same pattern as the first, ensuring both your AC and Maximal Aerobic Power are pushed towards their limit. To give it that extra kick, we added a couple of 30-second efforts with 30 seconds of recovery (having flashbacks to Pain Shakes from _Blender_, are we?). These final efforts are just hard enough\u2014with just enough rest\u2014that you will fully deplete your AC, forcing your MAP to pick up the slack.\n",

Forcing your body to churn out power right below, at, and just above threshold for 20-minute intervals dramatically improves your ability to generate sustainable power. It\u0027s great for building your FTP (unless you have an unusually low MAP...in which case you\u0027re going to find this session a bit challenging).\n\n\u200B\n\nBy itself, the 3-minute time trial effort at the end would not be much to deal with, but after churning out threshold power for 40 minutes, hitting this 3-minute effort at 100% will ensure you stress your MAP enough to give this session a slight edge over other FTP Builder workouts.\n",

That\u0027s why Grunter von Agony, Sufferlandrian Team Director, is sending you to compete in The Omnium at the UCI World Track Championships. Over the course of 50 minutes, you\u0027ll do battle in the six different races.\n\n\u200B\n\nNo two intervals in this workout are the same, with each one working slightly different Neuromuscular (NM), Anaerobic Capacity (AC), and Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) variations. No need for FTP here, friends. It\u0027s the perfect session to improve top-end power without having to do a ton of repetitive efforts.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe Scratch Race and Flying Lap have an easy enough lead-in that you get to put your max sprint to the full test. Add in the standing starts for the Individual Pursuit and Kilo, and you give your NM a real run-through. The repeated surges of the Elimination Race, the all-out nature of the Kilo, and the massive efforts you have to make in the points race really test your powers of recovery while working your AC all the way to the max.\n\n\u200B\n\nSince the efforts come in quick succession, and with most being over four minutes in length, your cardiovascular system never catches a real break, ensuring your MAP doesn\u2019t get left out of the equation.\n",

With the final intervals focusing more on short, repeated efforts, you\u0027ll stress your body\u0027s ability to recover when deeply fatigued, making this more than just an \u201Cendurance builder\u0022 workout, but one that will help you keep churning out power deep into the final kilometers of challenging rides or events.\n",

The structure ensures maximum time spent near VO2 max, boosting endurance and power while helping you mentally tackle each challenge one manageable piece at a time.\n\n\u200B\n\nRecovery is tailored to the effort you just completed, giving your legs the reset they need to dive into the next wave of intensity. Paired with inspiring footage of the Brabantsje Pils Spring Classics, you\u0027ll feel the grit of the cobbles and the thrill of the chase as you power through climbs and recover on the descents. Remember: keep your form smooth, your breathing controlled, and your mind locked into each effort. Treat every interval as a race within the ride. The dips in intensity are there to help you, not let you off the hook\u2014this is one ride you won\u2019t forget!\n",
