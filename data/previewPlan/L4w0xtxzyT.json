It explores extraordinary personal stories of ordinary cyclists taking on iconic endurance event Chase The Sun, revealing the power of the humble bicycle to transform lives and help save the planet.\n\nThe film features contributions from broadcaster and ITV\u2019s voice of the Tour de France Ned Boulting, author and blogger Jools Walker, Turner Prize-winning artist Sir Richard Long and 4x Mountain Bike World Champion Tracy Moseley.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: the workout accompanying this film varies from endurance to tempo to sub-threshold. The higher intensity efforts aren\u0027t the hardest you\u0027ll experience so that you can keep your attention on the film, however, they are just hard enough to help improve your FTP, oxygen utilization efficiency, and the ability to recover quickly between hard efforts. The workout intensity reflects the intensity of the riders in many places, so you may feel as if you\u0027re climbing Mont Ventoux or that you\u0027re a part of Cav\u0027s lead-out train on the run into the finish line.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s how to turn off on-screen graphics for the best viewing experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterInspiration)\n",

The 22km climb is long, so we break it up into three sections for you. First, you\u0027ll have a nice long warm-up to ride into the village of Fabian. Once the proper climb starts, you\u0027ll ramp it up to a range between 70-90% threshold and hold it there. Toward the end, you\u0027ll start to work hard and finish off with an all-out assault on the summit. Along the way, you\u0027ll find out how the local wool is processed, how a network of ancient towers protected the region, why one house is covered in flowers, and what happened to all the local brown bears.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/3778259865)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

Your body can only handle so much time above FTP in any given week (or month, for that matter). But that doesn\u2019t mean you should sit around doing nothing the rest of the time.\n\n\u200B\n\nYour body is most efficient at clearing out lactate and other metabolic byproducts at 80-95% of FTP. This is one of the few sessions where you can consistently sit at that intensity and let your body churn away at this nice, efficient effort level. It\u0027s the ideal workout to end a hard, three-day block or add in during a rest week. It will give your body a little training stimulus while still allowing it to recover from whatever tortures you\u0027ve recently put it through.\n",

However, a small self-organized crew from Serbia and Germany set a mission to discover and reveal those stunning natural creations of Serbia. On a bicycle. In just five days, they traversed 450 kilometers across six mountains of Western Serbia, and climbed around 11,000 meters to film and produce what you are about to experience.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: The workout accompanying this film is a recovery session.

              "description": "Meandering along the scenic River Iller, it\u2019s time to break out your gravel bike for a classic cadence build and hold session. We\u2019ll kick off with 5 x 30-second cadence builds, allowing for 2 minutes of recovery between each, before moving on to 5 x 60-second cadence holds, again with 2 minutes recovery.\n\nWhile this session may be short, it\u2019s a key part of your weekly plan, designed to keep you efficient and in top form, even when the cadence ramps up. Stay smooth and steady\u2014and remember, \u201Cno bobbing!\u201D\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Builds:** The name of the game here is absolute peak cadence, not peak power. To achieve this, you need to be in a small gear and have very light resistance. Starting at 90-RPM, steadily increase your cadence until you reach your absolute max with about 5-seconds left, and hold that to the end. Your limiting factor on these efforts needs to be leg speed. If resistance/power output is your limiting factor, try starting in an easier gear, or shift into an easier gear 15-seconds in. Bouncing in the saddle is okay for this drill.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Holds**: These efforts require you to maintain the highest cadence you can without starting to bounce in the saddle. For some of you that will be 100-RPM, for others, it will be 150-RPM. The key is to settle into YOUR peak sustainable cadence. Like the Builds, the goal here is not high power, so these efforts are limited to 90% of FTP. Do not be surprised if your heart rate is well into Zone 4 by the time you hit the last few holds.\n\n\nTo properly execute this session, your effort between drills needs to be low. With limited recovery time between these maximal Neuromuscular Efforts, riding above Zone 1 between efforts will only reduce your ability to max out your cadence. While the power targets between are Zone 1, do not be surprised if your heart rate does not drop below Zone 2 after the first couple builds.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/9885886076)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty. As founder of The Col Collective, Mike has made a career out of riding, filming, and telling the story of epic rides and mountains across the continent. As your On Location co-creator and host, Mike\u0027s engaging character, curious mind, and friendly nature will have you cueing up your next ride with him before you\u0027ve even finished the cool-down._\n",

A small country in the Balkan Peninsula that hides some of the most beautiful natural wonders and unique cultural heritage in this part of the world. Yet it remains unknown to many. Only the alternative, curious and brave plan their journeys in this hidden gem. However, a small self-organized crew from Serbia and Germany set a mission to discover and reveal those stunning natural creations of Serbia. On a bicycle. In just five days, they traversed 450 kilometers across six mountains of Western Serbia, and climbed around 11,000 meters to film and produce what you are about to experience.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: The workout accompanying this film is a recovery session. It\u0027s a very low-intensity ride, with your power remaining at or below 50% of FTP (an RPE less than 2.5 on a scale from 1 to 10) and your heart rate in Zone 1. The intensity and cadence targets will vary throughout this session to keep it interesting, but not so much that it distracts you from the story.\n",

We\u2019ll be breaking this 10km climb down into three distinct sections, kicking off with a block of 6 x 50 second high tempo efforts with a 10 second burst out of the saddle before taking a swift breather before getting back on it. As we climb through the pine forest we\u2019ll switch things up a touch, alternating between low and high cadence for 30 seconds at a time for around 7 minutes. We\u2019ll then revert back to our 50 second high tempo with 10 second burst out of the saddle efforts before we build up our effort to the summit. This is going to be a challenging workout so make sure you\u2019re ready and whatever you do don\u2019t forget to take a moment to look at the views!!\n\n\u200B\n\nThis workout combines multiple different interval types that focus on improving threshold power via over-under style efforts along with low cadence work for your muscular endurance. The first and last climbs also fire up your whole energy systems with some sprints to the summit.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/8735613403)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

              "description": "This is a technique-focused session designed to develop your agility, stability, range of motion, and foot speed. There is no focus on heart rate zones so you may choose to leave your monitor at home for these sessions. Between sets of each drill, you should jog/walk easily to fully recover between the efforts. While these efforts shouldn\u2019t be too taxing on you, the key is perfect form, so you want to be hitting each one rested enough that you can maintain great form for the duration. You should take a bit of extra rest between techniques, again to ensure you are rested and can nail the form. Before starting the workout, familiarize yourself with the format for high knees, butt kicks, skipping, carioca and strides. Find a flat track, field, or 50-100m of open space to perform this workout (football and soccer fields are great for this).\n\n\u200B\n\nFor help understanding your run workout and calculating your pace zones, please see [this article](https://wahoosystm.com/RunningSessionFAQ).\n\nLearn how to perform your [**Running Drills**](https://support.wahoofitness.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404080091922-Running-Drills) here.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-up:**\n\nStart off with 5-10 minutes of easy jogging/walking.\n\nHigh Knees: 2-3 sets of 50m high knees.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- Take short strides, bringing your knees up high enough that your upper legs are parallel to the ground. Focus on achieving high knees AND quick turnover, or performing as many reps as possible in a short distance.\n\n**Butt Kicks:**\n\n2-3 sets of 50m butt kicks.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- This should actually look similar to a high knee drill, but with the heels coming up to touch the bottom of your butt. Take short strides while using your hamstrings to lift your heels up beneath your butt. Your knees should come up in front of your body while pulling your heels up beneath your hips, rather than keeping your quads and knees below and in line with your hips.\n\n**Skipping:**\n\n3-4 sets of 50m skipping.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- Focus on a high knee drive and swinging your arms at your sides like you would when running.\n\n**Carioca:**\n\n4 sets of 30m Carioca in each direction (8 total).\n\nRest for 20 seconds between direction changes (at your discretion).\n\n- For this drill, you need to face sidewise to the direction you want to go. Start off moving to the right. Bring your left knee up and across your body and put your left foot in front of your right foot. Step your right foot to the right so it is parallel with your left leg again (at this point you should be positioned in the same direction and orientation that you were at the start. Next step your left leg behind your right leg, again so it lands on the right side of your right leg. Then bring your right leg back across your body, once again ending up in the starting position. Repeat this pattern for 25-30m.\n\n**Strides:**\n\n2-3 sets of 60m; Gradually build effort from RPE 3-8.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between. These are comprised of a steady acceleration over 60-80m up to 5k pace. The goal is to increase speed after each step, so you are reaching maximum speed at the end of the 60-80m stretch. You want to focus on keeping your shoulders, neck, and jaw relaxed while maintaining strong knee drive, straight and compact arm swing, planting the feet beneath the hips, and fast turnover.\n\n\u200B\n\nHigh Knees \u002B Butt Kicks:\n\nFinish these drills with one set each of 50m high knees and butt kicks.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool-down:**\n\nWalk or jog for 5 minutes to cool down.\n\nIn case you need to brush up on your running [drills](https://wahoosystm.com/RunningSessionFAQ)\n",

You\u0027ve been chosen to help get your team\u0027s star sprinter, Alexander Kristoff, in position to take the win. You need to be ready to bury yourself in service of your team. It might not be the most glamorous, but it will earn you the respect and admiration of your teammates. There are stars and there are water carriers: today you\u0027re loading up with bottles.\n\n\u200B\n\n**About ProRides**\n\nHere\u2019s your chance to experience what it\u2019s like to ride in the biggest races in the world, thanks to SYSTM\u2019s 4DP platform. We\u2019ve taken the first-person camera footage and power data from a pro cyclist and analyzed it to determine which part of their 4DP\u00AE profile each of their efforts corresponds to. But since few of us can put down pro-level watts, we made it so all of the efforts are scaled to your own personal 4DP\u00AE profile. That means you get to experience exactly what the pros experience relative to your own abilities. When they sprint, you sprint. When they attack, you attack. When they sit up, you get to take it (relatively) easy. It\u0027s the most immersive, realistic race simulation out there.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s some more information on how to create the most immersive ProRides experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterProRides)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Featured Footage: **Velon\n",

              "description": "Have you been riding, but not riding too hard? Have you been putting in lots of easy and endurance rides but not much intensity? Are you ready to bring intervals back into your routine, but not quite prepared to face up to a session like _Nine Hammers_ or _The Shovel_? Then this is the session for you.\n\n\u200B\n\nIf you love _Recharger_ then you\u0027re going to tough love_ No Place Like Home_ - the perfect re-introduction to a little bit of hard work. It will wake up your legs, lungs and mind, reminding them what it means to dig deep but without really working too hard or for too long. The workout is expertly designed by Wahoo\u0027s Head of Sports Science, Sir Neal Henderson, as a gradual step back into Suffering when self-doubt has taken hold of you and motivation may be low. While you\u2019re riding it, you\u0027ll soon realize that you\u0027re stronger than you think and that you _can_ work hard. You\u0027ll also realize that you really shouldn\u0027t have ever left Sufferlandria -- Border Control takes these things very seriously.\n\n\u200B\n\nAnd when the session is finished? A wave of endorphins kicks in - and if you\u2019ve done it right, you\u0027ll feel a sense of elation and a little sting in the legs that reminds you why you were born to Suffer and why there truly is..._No Place Like Home._\n",

The SYSTM ProRide series allows you to experience what it\u2019s like to be in the biggest bike races in the world, thanks to the SYSTM 4DP\u00AE platform. We\u2019ve taken the first-person camera footage and power data from a pro cyclist and analyzed it to determine which part of their 4DP\u00AE profile each of their efforts corresponds to. But since few of us can put down pro-level watts, we made it so all of the efforts are scaled to your own personal 4DP\u00AE profile. That means you get to experience exactly what the pros experience relative to your own abilities. When they sprint, you sprint. When they attack, you attack. When they sit up, you get to take it (relatively) easy. It\u0027s the most immersive, realistic race simulation out there. Note: To ensure the most immersive riding experience possible, this workout does not have music, sound effects, heart rate, or cadence targets.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s some more information on how to create the most immersive ProRides experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterProRides)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Featured Footage:** Velon\n",

              "description": "This is a technique-focused session designed to develop your agility, stability, range of motion, and foot speed. There is no focus on heart rate zones so you may choose to leave your monitor at home for these sessions. Between sets of each drill, you should jog/walk easily to fully recover between the efforts. While these efforts shouldn\u2019t be too taxing on you, the key is perfect form, so you want to be hitting each one rested enough that you can maintain great form for the duration. You should take a bit of extra rest between techniques, again to ensure you are rested and can nail the form. Before starting the workout, familiarize yourself with the format for high knees, butt kicks, skipping, carioca and strides. Find a flat track, field, or 50-100m of open space to perform this workout (football and soccer fields are great for this).\n\n\u200B\n\nFor help understanding your run workout and calculating your pace zones, please see [this article](https://wahoosystm.com/RunningSessionFAQ).\n\nLearn how to perform your [**Running Drills**](https://support.wahoofitness.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404080091922-Running-Drills) here.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-up:**\n\nStart off with 5-10 minutes of easy jogging/walking.\n\nHigh Knees: 2-3 sets of 50m high knees.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- Take short strides, bringing your knees up high enough that your upper legs are parallel to the ground. Focus on achieving high knees AND quick turnover, or performing as many reps as possible in a short distance.\n\n**Butt Kicks:**\n\n2-3 sets of 50m butt kicks.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- This should actually look similar to a high knee drill, but with the heels coming up to touch the bottom of your butt. Take short strides while using your hamstrings to lift your heels up beneath your butt. Your knees should come up in front of your body while pulling your heels up beneath your hips, rather than keeping your quads and knees below and in line with your hips.\n\n**Skipping:**\n\n3-4 sets of 50m skipping.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- Focus on a high knee drive and swinging your arms at your sides like you would when running.\n\n**Carioca:**\n\n4 sets of 30m Carioca in each direction (8 total).\n\nRest for 20 seconds between direction changes (at your discretion).\n\n- For this drill, you need to face sidewise to the direction you want to go. Start off moving to the right. Bring your left knee up and across your body and put your left foot in front of your right foot. Step your right foot to the right so it is parallel with your left leg again (at this point you should be positioned in the same direction and orientation that you were at the start. Next step your left leg behind your right leg, again so it lands on the right side of your right leg. Then bring your right leg back across your body, once again ending up in the starting position. Repeat this pattern for 25-30m.\n\n**Strides:**\n\n2-3 sets of 60m; Gradually build effort from RPE 3-8.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between. These are comprised of a steady acceleration over 60-80m up to 5k pace. The goal is to increase speed after each step, so you are reaching maximum speed at the end of the 60-80m stretch. You want to focus on keeping your shoulders, neck, and jaw relaxed while maintaining strong knee drive, straight and compact arm swing, planting the feet beneath the hips, and fast turnover.\n\n\u200B\n\nHigh Knees \u002B Butt Kicks:\n\nFinish these drills with one set each of 50m high knees and butt kicks.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool-down:**\n\nWalk or jog for 5 minutes to cool down.\n\nIn case you need to brush up on your running [drills](https://wahoosystm.com/RunningSessionFAQ)\n",

And through the bleeding eyes of Sufferlandrians, what could possibly be more beautiful than the sharp, saw-tooth profile of the workout you see before you? Full of gorgeous, shapely, shimmering blocks of yellow Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) efforts interspersed with mercifully brief and slightly inadequate recoveries, it\u0027s a real stunner.\n\n\u200B\n\nBut you know what\u0027s even better looking than this alluring workout? You (after you\u0027ve completed the workout, that is). Originally designed by our Head of Sports Science, Neal Henderson, for his professional athletes, The Model is a beautiful portrait of MAP brutality. It\u0027s one of those sessions that you think you can\u0027t finish, but always somehow do. It will leave you breathless, feeling all tingly, a bit confused and lying in a blubbering heap. It\u0027s a look. It will also deliver a nice boost to your fitness that always looks and feels good.\n\n\u200B\n\nA true love letter to the beauty of professional cycling, The Model features a banging soundtrack and thrilling footage from both the men\u0027s and women\u0027s pelotons. With its eclectic design, effects, and graphics, you\u0027ll find yourself unable to tear your eyes away from the action on screen (assuming you can lift them from your stem).\n",

The first, male American to win the Tour de France, LeMond came back from the brink of death to beat his famed rivals in the historic and nail-biting race at the 1989 Tour de France.\n\nDirected by Alex Holmes and featuring exclusive interviews with LeMond and his wife Kathy as well as, never before seen footage, The Last Rider is an exhilarating portrait of one of the greatest athletes of our time.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: the workout accompanying this film varies from endurance to tempo to sub-threshold. The higher intensity efforts aren\u0027t the hardest you\u0027ll experience so that you can keep your attention on the film, however, they are just hard enough to help improve your FTP, oxygen utilization efficiency, and the ability to recover quickly between hard efforts. The workout intensity reflects the intensity of the riders in many places, so you may feel as if you\u0027re climbing Mont Ventoux or that you\u0027re a part of Cav\u0027s lead-out train on the run into the finish line.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s how to turn off on-screen graphics for the best viewing experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterInspiration)\n",

Originally created in Coach Sir Neal Henderson\u0027s Penn State dorm room in 1992, it\u0027s his weapon of choice for bringing the pain (shakes).\n\n\u200B\n\nWhat\u0027s in the Blender? First, a variety of longer efforts build sustained power while also making sure you\u0027re sufficiently fatigued. This initial beatdown is necessary to ensure you get the maximum benefit from _Blender_\u0027s infamous \u0027Pain Shakes.\u0027 Three sets of these little devils help you develop a supernatural ability to recover from big efforts. The bonus is that you also beef up your ability to produce high-end power, building Anaerobic Capacity and Maximal Aerobic Power simultaneously.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe threshold efforts at the end are the bitter cherry on the sundae, improving your body\u0027s ability to produce aerobic power and helping make sure your FTP will get the same boost as your AC and MAP. A rising tide of lactic acid raises all boats. Oh, and clocking in at one hour and 40 minutes, Blender will also help whip your endurance into a frenzy.\n",

A small country in the Balkan Peninsula that hides some of the most beautiful natural wonders and unique cultural heritage in this part of the world. Yet it remains unknown to many. Only the alternative, curious and brave plan their journeys in this hidden gem. However, a small self-organized crew from Serbia and Germany set a mission to discover and reveal those stunning natural creations of Serbia. On a bicycle. In just five days, they traversed 450 kilometers across six mountains of Western Serbia, and climbed around 11,000 meters to film and produce what you are about to experience.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: This is a great way to watch a compelling documentary while developing your baseline aerobic fitness.

Made This presented by Wahoo \u002B MAAP is a series of behind-the-scenes, unfiltered front-row access with women\u0027s pro cycling team Lifeplus - Wahoo:\n\n1. **Sisterhood: **Dedication, challenges, commitment, belief, family and sisterhood are all components of what it takes to be a professional racing team. In the first of a series of behind-the-scenes, unfiltered front-row access with team Lifeplus-Wahoo, MADE THIS is a collection of short films from MAAP Pro Team Racing that reveals what it takes to make a champion a champion.\n2. **Prepared for anything: **The excitement of Holy Week at the Tour de Flanders is upon us, and Team Lifeplus-Wahoo is gearing up for a challenging ride. With 163km to conquer, featuring 12 climbs and seven cobbled stretches, not to mention seven slippery flat stone sections\u2014all under a deluge of rain\u2014anything could happen.\n3. **Passion on the cobbles: **Join us as we dive deep into the chaotic and exhilarating world of the Paris-Roubaix, one of cycling\u0027s most grueling races. Amidst the cobblestones and mud, Team Lifeplus-Wahoo faces the ultimate test of endurance and skill. With a new lineup and high stakes, the team navigates the unpredictable nature of this legendary race, where luck can play a huge role and every second counts.\n4. **Home sweet home: **After a fallow year for the tour, the team are eager to push for results in front of an expectant crowd. But instead of the warm welcome on familiar roads, disaster strikes the first morning of the race. As national news of the unfortunate event breaks, the team are left wondering if they\u0027ll be able to compete or if this becomes a home visit to forget. What follows is a true act of human kindness and a gesture that symbolises the unifying bond of the women\u0027s pro peloton.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: The workout accompanying this film is a recovery session. It\u0027s a very low-intensity ride, with your power remaining at or below 50% of FTP (an RPE less than 2.5 on a scale from 1 to 10) and your heart rate in Zone 1. The intensity and cadence targets will vary throughout this session to keep it interesting, but not so much that it distracts you from the story.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s how to turn off on-screen graphics for the best viewing experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterInspiration)\n",

While it\u0027s not as comprehensive or as accurate as our main fitness test, _Full Frontal_, it\u0027s far more approachable and easier to pace for new riders. It also doesn\u0027t require any special preparation. You just need to feel relatively fresh.\n\n\u200B\n\nBased on more than a year of research (and after dozens of lab tests and thousands of online tests) and using sophisticated analysis of power and heart rate data, _Half Monty_ is far more accurate and comprehensive than standard ramp tests.\n\n\u200B\n\nIt also tells you more about who you are as an athlete. _Half Monty_ provides you with your FTP, Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP), and Cycling Threshold Heart Rate (cTHR), all of which we use to personalize your workout targets.\n\n\u200B\n\nIf you\u0027re still using the 4DP estimates when you set up your account, _Half Monty_ will also refine your AC and NM estimates (but will not do so if you\u0027ve done _Full Frontal_ or manually adjusted your estimates). If you want fully accurate AC and NM, as well as your Rider Type, Strengths, Weaknesses, and training plans adjusted to those Strengths and Weaknesses, you\u0027ll need to expose yourself to the _Full Frontal_ 4DP fitness test.\n\n\u200B\n\nReady to climb the ramp? You\u0027ll need the following before you start:\n\n- A heart rate monitor if you want the most accurate results. Don\u0027t have one? Order one [HERE](https://wahoofitness.com/devices)\n- Some kind of power device connected (trainer, power meter, virtual power, etc.)\n- Be ready to pay close attention to the instructions in the workout\n- Be sure your profile is complete and up-to-date (Profile \u003E About You). Accurate information helps us make our calculations\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to \u0027[Why Fitness Testing Matters](https://the-knowledge-by-wahoo-sports-science.simplecast.com/episodes/testing-testing-1-2-3-why-fitness-testing-matters)\u0027 on The Knowledge Podcast by Wahoo Sports Science.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s some more information on how to get the most from your fitness test.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterFitnessAssessment)\n",

There is no focus on heart rate zones so you may choose to leave your monitor at home for these sessions. Between sets of each drill, you should jog/walk easily to fully recover between the efforts. While these efforts shouldn\u2019t be too taxing on you, the key is perfect form, so you want to be hitting each one rested enough that you can maintain great form for the duration. You should take a bit of extra rest between techniques, again to ensure you are rested and can nail the form. Before starting the workout, familiarize yourself with the format for high knees, butt kicks, skipping, carioca and strides. Find a flat track, field, or 50-100m of open space to perform this workout (football and soccer fields are great for this).\n\n\u200B\n\nFor help understanding your run workout and calculating your pace zones, please see [this article](https://wahoosystm.com/RunningSessionFAQ).\n\nLearn how to perform your [**Running Drills**](https://support.wahoofitness.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404080091922-Running-Drills) here.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-up:**\n\nStart off with 5-10 minutes of easy jogging/walking.\n\nHigh Knees: 2-3 sets of 50m high knees.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- Take short strides, bringing your knees up high enough that your upper legs are parallel to the ground. Focus on achieving high knees AND quick turnover, or performing as many reps as possible in a short distance.\n\n**Butt Kicks:**\n\n2-3 sets of 50m butt kicks.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- This should actually look similar to a high knee drill, but with the heels coming up to touch the bottom of your butt. Take short strides while using your hamstrings to lift your heels up beneath your butt. Your knees should come up in front of your body while pulling your heels up beneath your hips, rather than keeping your quads and knees below and in line with your hips.\n\n**Skipping:**\n\n3-4 sets of 50m skipping.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- Focus on a high knee drive and swinging your arms at your sides like you would when running.\n\n**Carioca:**\n\n4 sets of 30m Carioca in each direction (8 total).\n\nRest for 20 seconds between direction changes (at your discretion).\n\n- For this drill, you need to face sidewise to the direction you want to go. Start off moving to the right. Bring your left knee up and across your body and put your left foot in front of your right foot. Step your right foot to the right so it is parallel with your left leg again (at this point you should be positioned in the same direction and orientation that you were at the start. Next step your left leg behind your right leg, again so it lands on the right side of your right leg. Then bring your right leg back across your body, once again ending up in the starting position. Repeat this pattern for 25-30m.\n\n**Strides:**\n\n2-3 sets of 60m; Gradually build effort from RPE 3-8.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between. These are comprised of a steady acceleration over 60-80m up to 5k pace. The goal is to increase speed after each step, so you are reaching maximum speed at the end of the 60-80m stretch. You want to focus on keeping your shoulders, neck, and jaw relaxed while maintaining strong knee drive, straight and compact arm swing, planting the feet beneath the hips, and fast turnover.\n\n\u200B\n\nHigh Knees \u002B Butt Kicks:\n\nFinish these drills with one set each of 50m high knees and butt kicks.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool-down:**\n\nWalk or jog for 5 minutes to cool down.\n\nIn case you need to brush up on your running [drills](https://wahoosystm.com/RunningSessionFAQ)\n",

The then-26-year-old Belgian was taken to hospital with serious head injuries, including a fractured skull and bleeding on the brain, and was in a coma for months. At the time doctors feared he may never regain consciousness.\n\n\u200B\n\nStig\u0027s story is a universal story of the bad luck of one young man and his endless perseverance and positivity to overcome. It\u2019s a story of unconditional love from his family and friends. It\u2019s a story of hope and even though many of us won\u2019t face something as severe as Stig, we all struggle with life sometimes. There is a lesson in Stig\u2019s contagious smile for all of us.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, riding to this Inspiration film is a great way to watch an interesting film while developing your baseline aerobic fitness. The intensity of this workout will vary mostly between 60-70% of FTP, with heart rate remaining entirely in zone 2. This session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s how to turn off on-screen graphics for the best viewing experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterInspiration)\n",

After receiving their bikes in Memphis, TN - Victory Bicycle Studio got them all ready and shipped them to Arkansas to be reunited. In this episode we hear from Rich about why he chose to take on something as daunting as FTGU as well as learn valuable skills with The Ride Series team and 15 of our closest FTGU friends.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Episode 3: Redefining Limits**\n\nIn episode 3 we see our team begin to understand what it will take to finish SBT GRVL. We visit Gunnison, CO for a riding camp to push the limits 6 weeks out from race day. Our goal is to ride the distance and ascent of the race over two days at altitude and see what people struggle with. We also check in with Lou and his path to FTGU.

              "description": "The 3x25-minute sub-threshold workout is one of the most classic interval sessions out there, so prepare for a trip to the northern Painlands for this FTP-builder. The reason the 3x25 sub-threshold workout is so popular is that it is easy to follow, helps teach good pacing, and gives you a great threshold training stimulus.\n\n\u200B\n\nIn this case, you\u0027re looking at three, (roughly) 25-minute blocks at around 90% of your FTP, an effort we refer to as \u0022Sub-Threshold\u0022. Many refer to this intensity as \u0022Sweet-Spot\u0022, but we prefer Sub-Threshold, as the real key is to never let your power creep above your FTP. Staying just below threshold ensures that your effort remains at an intensity you know your body can handle but that is close to what would not be sustainable.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe only way you\u0027re going to make it through three of these efforts is if you pace yourself properly. Everyone feels just fine for the first 5 minutes of the first effort, and are often tempted to go harder. Don\u0027t be that person. More often than not, that person blows up spectacularly in the second interval, unable to finish the session. Or they have to ride that second interval at lower power, turning it into a Tempo session, which is not the goal.\n\n\u200B\n\nGetting a sense of how these efforts \u0022bite\u0022 towards the end is vital to learning how to pace yourself over longer steady-state efforts; whether that\u0027s a time trial, local climb, breakaway, triathlon, or even a good old fitness test. In each of those cases, the pacing is key. Learning how your perceived effort can steadily climb even though your power remains unchanged is critical to good pacing.\n\n\u200B\n\nSo how do you know if you are doing this one right? As we said, the first 5 minutes should feel relatively easy. Around that 5-minute mark, your heart rate should stop climbing, and settle into 2-5% below your Lactate Threshold Heart Rate (LTHR). If your heart rate is climbing for the entire effort and goes above your LTHR, then you are going too hard.\n\nIf you hit the 10-minute mark, your legs feel fine, and your heart rate is still in Zone 3, then you aren\u0027t going hard enough.\n\nIf you\u0027ve never done a session like this before, you can consider only doing the first 20-minute effort, or even sticking to just the first 15 minutes of each effort. There\u0027s no shame in building up to this full session, so don\u0027t be afraid to pause and fast forward as needed.\n\n\u200B\n\nNailing this session is really about getting in tune with your body and understanding what the edge between a sustainable and an unsustainable effort feels like. Not being able to complete this workout is fairly common, so don\u0027t beat yourself up if you can\u0027t make it through the first few times. As long as you come away from this session with a better understanding of how to pace longer efforts, you\u0027ve improved as an athlete.\n",

The goal of this session is to accumulate a significant amount of time near your VO2max, or the point at which your body is consuming as much oxygen as it possibly can. That means your heart rate and breathing rate will both be near their max by the end of each interval, especially in the final few intervals.\n\n\u200B\n\nSince it takes time for your heart rate and breathing rate to match your effort, for the first part of each interval, you will be tapping into your Anaerobic Capacity to produce the required power. To account for this, we have limited the recovery duration to be equal to the interval duration. Limited recovery ensures that you will drain your Anaerobic Capacity before the end of the intervals, meaning your body will be forced to produce as much power as possible using oxygen. Pushing your aerobic system to its max like this is not just great for improving MAP, but also your FTP. Since MAP limits your FTP, improving your MAP is vital to the continued growth of your FTP.\n\n\u200B\n\nBy the end of this session, you will have accumulated 20-minutes near your Maximal Aerobic Power, which will leave your legs aching and your lungs burning.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR \u003C70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 150% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n5minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort** x10\n\nWork: 2 minutes @ RPE 9 -- 95-105%% of MAP (115-135% of FTP)\n\nRest: 2 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n50 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR \u003C70%\n",

              "description": "This is a technique-focused session designed to develop your agility, stability, range of motion, and foot speed. There is no focus on heart rate zones so you may choose to leave your monitor at home for these sessions. Between sets of each drill, you should jog/walk easily to fully recover between the efforts. While these efforts shouldn\u2019t be too taxing on you, the key is perfect form, so you want to be hitting each one rested enough that you can maintain great form for the duration. You should take a bit of extra rest between techniques, again to ensure you are rested and can nail the form. Before starting the workout, familiarize yourself with the format for high knees, butt kicks, skipping, carioca and strides. Find a flat track, field, or 50-100m of open space to perform this workout (football and soccer fields are great for this).\n\n\u200B\n\nFor help understanding your run workout and calculating your pace zones, please see [this article](https://wahoosystm.com/RunningSessionFAQ).\n\nLearn how to perform your [**Running Drills**](https://support.wahoofitness.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404080091922-Running-Drills) here.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-up:**\n\nStart off with 5-10 minutes of easy jogging/walking.\n\nHigh Knees: 2-3 sets of 50m high knees.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- Take short strides, bringing your knees up high enough that your upper legs are parallel to the ground. Focus on achieving high knees AND quick turnover, or performing as many reps as possible in a short distance.\n\n**Butt Kicks:**\n\n2-3 sets of 50m butt kicks.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- This should actually look similar to a high knee drill, but with the heels coming up to touch the bottom of your butt. Take short strides while using your hamstrings to lift your heels up beneath your butt. Your knees should come up in front of your body while pulling your heels up beneath your hips, rather than keeping your quads and knees below and in line with your hips.\n\n**Skipping:**\n\n3-4 sets of 50m skipping.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- Focus on a high knee drive and swinging your arms at your sides like you would when running.\n\n**Carioca:**\n\n4 sets of 30m Carioca in each direction (8 total).\n\nRest for 20 seconds between direction changes (at your discretion).\n\n- For this drill, you need to face sidewise to the direction you want to go. Start off moving to the right. Bring your left knee up and across your body and put your left foot in front of your right foot. Step your right foot to the right so it is parallel with your left leg again (at this point you should be positioned in the same direction and orientation that you were at the start. Next step your left leg behind your right leg, again so it lands on the right side of your right leg. Then bring your right leg back across your body, once again ending up in the starting position. Repeat this pattern for 25-30m.\n\n**Strides:**\n\n2-3 sets of 60m; Gradually build effort from RPE 3-8.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between. These are comprised of a steady acceleration over 60-80m up to 5k pace. The goal is to increase speed after each step, so you are reaching maximum speed at the end of the 60-80m stretch. You want to focus on keeping your shoulders, neck, and jaw relaxed while maintaining strong knee drive, straight and compact arm swing, planting the feet beneath the hips, and fast turnover.\n\n\u200B\n\nHigh Knees \u002B Butt Kicks:\n\nFinish these drills with one set each of 50m high knees and butt kicks.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool-down:**\n\nWalk or jog for 5 minutes to cool down.\n\nIn case you need to brush up on your running [drills](https://wahoosystm.com/RunningSessionFAQ)\n",

The first, _Les Alpes_, is the story of Mike\u0027s non-stop ride from Evian-Les-Bains to Nice across the heart of the Alps: a journey of 677km with 17 mountain passes and more than 16,000 meters of climbing. The second, _The Road to Mont Blanc_, sees Mike tackle a 1,000 km non-stop journey across 21 mountains in the Dolomites, Eastern and Swiss Alps before finishing at Mont Blanc. Featuring never-before-seen footage and exclusive commentary by Mike Cotty himself.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: The workout accompanying this film is a recovery session. Intensity is low, with power remaining at or below 50% of FTP (2.5 on a scale from 1 to 10) with heart rate targets entirely in Zone 1. The intensity and cadence targets will vary throughout this session to keep it interesting, but not so much that it distracts you from the story.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s how to turn off on-screen graphics for the best viewing experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterInspiration)\n\n\u200B\n",

              "description": "This workout combines several technique driven intervals. These will improve your overall form and efficiency on the bike. The first two drills, Cadence Holds and Builds, are designed to improve the way you recruit your leg, glute and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke. They do this by forcing you to sustain a cadence just above \u0027comfortable\u0027 and by pushing you to your maximal cadence.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe last drill, Single Leg Efforts, ask you to unclip one leg and ride at a steady, single-legged effort. This forces you to pull up on the pedal instead of just pushing down and ensures maximal muscle awareness and engagement. This workout is best done while riding indoors on a trainer because even small variations in terrain can affect your ability to properly execute this workout. The majority of this workout is done in heart rate Z1/2 /// 50-75% of threshold /// RPE 2-5. You should keep the effort level below threshold (heart rate Z4, 100% of threshold, RPE 7-8) during the max cadence efforts.\n\n\u200B\n\nWORKOUT GOALS:\n\n- To improve stillness and stability at high cadences.\n- To improve muscle fiber engagement for improved efficiency at all cadences.\n- To increase maximum cadence.\n- To make that pedal stroke as smooth as butter.\n\nCADENCE TARGETS:\n\n- Warm-up 80-90rpm\n- Build: 90-150rpm\n- Hold: 115rpm\n- Single Leg: 85rpm\n\nListen to The Knowledge podcast, by Wahoo Sports Science - The Benefits of High Cadence Training: [https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence](https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n3 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 3\n\nRest Between Sets: 8 minutes @ RPE 23 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: N/A\n\n**Interval**\n\nCadence Build: 30 seconds @ RPE 8 -- Starting at 90RPM Build to Max RPM -- Max Power is NOT Goal\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nCadence Hold: 45 seconds @ RPE 7.5 -- \u003C100% FTP -- Highest RPM you can hold without Bouncing\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nSingle Leg: 1 minute @ RPE 6 -- Single Leg Only -- \u003C50% of FTP\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nSingle Leg: 1 minute @ RPE 6 -- Single Leg Only, Opposite Leg -- \u003C50% of FTP (100% of FTP with both legs = 50% of FTP\n\nwith one leg)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n8 minutes 15 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

Over the course of 50 minutes, you\u0027ll do battle in the six different races.\n\n\u200B\n\nNo two intervals in this workout are the same, with each one working slightly different Neuromuscular (NM), Anaerobic Capacity (AC), and Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) variations. No need for FTP here, friends. It\u0027s the perfect session to improve top-end power without having to do a ton of repetitive efforts.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe Scratch Race and Flying Lap have an easy enough lead-in that you get to put your max sprint to the full test. Add in the standing starts for the Individual Pursuit and Kilo, and you give your NM a real run-through. The repeated surges of the Elimination Race, the all-out nature of the Kilo, and the massive efforts you have to make in the points race really test your powers of recovery while working your AC all the way to the max.\n\n\u200B\n\nSince the efforts come in quick succession, and with most being over four minutes in length, your cardiovascular system never catches a real break, ensuring your MAP doesn\u2019t get left out of the equation.\n",

In June, Heather tackled the Unbound Gravel 200, often hailed as the \u0022Super Bowl\u0022 of gravel bike racing, and the iconic Western States Endurance Run, the world\u2019s oldest 100-mile trail race.

We\u2019ve taken the first-person camera footage and power data from a pro cyclist and analyzed it to determine which part of their 4DP\u00AE profile each of their efforts corresponds to. But since few of us can put down pro-level watts, we made it so all of the efforts are scaled to your own personal 4DP\u00AE profile. That means you get to experience exactly what the pros experience relative to your own abilities. When they sprint, you sprint. When they attack, you attack. When they sit up, you get to take it (relatively) easy. It\u0027s the most immersive, realistic race simulation out there.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s some more information on how to create the most immersive ProRides experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterProRides)\n",

A small country in the Balkan Peninsula that hides some of the most beautiful natural wonders and unique cultural heritage in this part of the world. Yet it remains unknown to many. Only the alternative, curious and brave plan their journeys in this hidden gem. However, a small self-organized crew from Serbia and Germany set a mission to discover and reveal those stunning natural creations of Serbia. On a bicycle. In just five days, they traversed 450 kilometers across six mountains of Western Serbia, and climbed around 11,000 meters to film and produce what you are about to experience.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: The workout accompanying this film is a recovery session.

The term \u0022Taper\u0022 refers to how you train in the week or so before your target event to ensure you deliver your best performance. Generally, tapering means reducing your total training volume but continuing to hit some high-intensity efforts. While there are individual variations in the best way to taper, this session has been used by countless professionals leading into the biggest races of their lives -- athletes like World Champions Rohan Dennis and Flora Duffy.\n\n\u200B\n\nWith 3 sets of micro-intervals (40/20s, 30/30s, and 20/40s) you will hit your system with just enough intensity to keep your legs sharp and responsive, without adding any real fatigue. Outside of those 3 sets of micro-intervals, this session is purposefully short and easy. This is a preparation session, not a training session! After all, your event is just around the corner and all of the important training is behind you. Riding harder or longer today will do absolutely nothing to increase your fitness by event day; in fact, all that would do is increase your fatigue, which will only hurt your performance. Rather, this session makes sure your body is humming along and ready to perform on the big day.\n",

Unlike other SYSTM sessions, this one should not be viewed as a stand-alone \u201Ctraining\u201D session, but rather, the ace up your sleeve you pull out when that big ride comes around. The key to this session is having you spend just enough time right around threshold, with sufficient recovery between efforts and a handful of sprints to prime all of your systems for tomorrow\u0027s event.  \n",

Developed by Head of Wahoo Sports Science Coach Neal Henderson, Full Frontal uses the same lab-verified testing protocol that Coach Neal has used at the highest level for over a decade with professional and amateur athletes.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis test will provide you with a complete Four-Dimensional Power profile, identify your Rider Type, and tell you exactly what aspects of your fitness you need to focus on to become a more complete cyclist. More importantly, SYSTM will then use your results to set personalized power targets for all of your workouts based on your unique profile, resulting in the most precise, effective workouts available. Your results will also be used to tailor all of your training plans.\n\n\u200B\n\nWe recommend re-testing with Full Frontal every 8-12 weeks or as prescribed by your training plan.\n\n\u200B\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to \u0027[Why Fitness Testing Matters](https://the-knowledge-by-wahoo-sports-science.simplecast.com/episodes/testing-testing-1-2-3-why-fitness-testing-matters)\u0027 on The Knowledge Podcast by Wahoo Sports Science\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s some more information on how to get the most from your fitness test.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterFitnessAssessment)\n",

Only the alternative, curious and brave plan their journeys in this hidden gem. However, a small self-organized crew from Serbia and Germany set a mission to discover and reveal those stunning natural creations of Serbia. On a bicycle. In just five days, they traversed 450 kilometers across six mountains of Western Serbia, and climbed around 11,000 meters to film and produce what you are about to experience.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: This is a great way to watch a compelling documentary while developing your baseline aerobic fitness.
