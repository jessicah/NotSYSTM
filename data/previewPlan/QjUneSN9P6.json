Level 4 will not disappoint in terms of overloading your chest, back, shoulders, arms, and core. Among other challenges, this workout includes two new tempo repetitions and work with resistance bands. The tempo training increases muscle activity as you react to sudden starts and stops while the resistance bands demand consistent focus with tension in all directions.
