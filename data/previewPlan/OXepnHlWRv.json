      "description": "#### **Special Focus: Upper Body Level 5**\n\nThis six week training plan is specifically designed to improve your upper body strength and mobility that is often overlooked in endurance athletes. If you are currently in an off-season build or a mid-season bump, with three short focused sessions per week, this plan is ideal.  The combination of strength and yoga sessions will target your shoulders, chest, arms, upper back, and core muscles to help you become a well rounded athlete.\n\n\u200B\n\nWe recommend that you only select Level 5 if you have recently completed Special Focus Upper Body Level 4. As with any of the SYSTM strength plans, take your time with each session and follow the proper progression.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis plan may be applied in conjunction with other Special Focused strength plans, such as Dynamic Focus or combined with one of the 12 week strength add-ons. However, If you choose to apply concurrent plans we suggest that you do so during the off-season or at a time when your endurance training volume is low.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe Special Focus stand alone plans follow a 2:1 progression and have three sessions per week on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.\n\n\u200B\n\nTime to get after it!\n",

We\u2019re going to continue the focus on increasing strength in the chest, back, shoulders and arms. Many of the exercises will be familiar from Level 1, but you\u2019ll likely find it a bit more challenging. That\u2019s because we\u2019ve made the durations a bit longer and the moves a little more complex.
