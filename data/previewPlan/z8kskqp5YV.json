      "description": "#### **Special Focus: Posterior Chain Level 5**\n\nThis six week training plan is specifically designed to improve strength and mobility through the shoulders, back, glutes and hamstrings. With three short focused sessions per week, this is an ideal way to activate your posterior chain, an area typically overlooked with endurance athletes. You can add this plan as an off-season block or as an extra bump to your regular season training.\n\n\u200B\n\nWe recommend that you only select Level 5 if you have recently completed Special Focus Posterior Chain Level 4. As with any of the SYSTM strength plans, take your time with each session and follow the proper progression.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis plan may be applied in conjunction with other Special Focused strength plans, such as Upper Body. However, If you choose to apply concurrent plans we suggest that you do so during the off-season or at a time when your endurance training volume is low.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe Special Focus stand alone plans follow a 2:1 progression and have three sessions per week on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.\n\n\u200B\n\nLet\u0027s get it on!\n",

We also introduce tempo movements that require extra focus on timing and eccentric loading. Even though this is only Level 2, you may find some of these moves difficult to perform.

To do this, we use a combination of isolated and integrated movements in a variety of body positions and build on the movements from Posterior Chain 1. We also introduce tempo movements that require extra focus on timing and eccentric loading. Even though this is only Level 2, you may find some of these moves difficult to perform.
