  "description": "#### Special Focus: Lower Body Level 1\n\nThis six week plan is specifically designed to boost your lower body mobility, strength and power. These short sessions will target your calves, glutes, hamstrings and quads to help you produce higher cadences at a given resistance as well as improve range of motion in your ankles, hips and low back.\n\n\u200B\n\nLevel 1 is the place to start if you are new to training your lower body or if you are coming back after an extended lay-off of over six months. As with all of the SYSTM strength plans, it is important to take your time and follow the progression in order to allow for adequate tissue adaptation, especially when adding jumping movements.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis plan may be applied in conjunction with other Special Focused strength plans, such as Upper Body or Core Focus. However, If you choose to apply concurrent plans we suggest that you do so during the off-season or at a time when your endurance training volume is low. We do not recommend adding Lower Body Focus if you are already on a training plan that includes a strength add-on.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe Special Focus stand alone plans follow a 2:1 progression and have three sessions per week on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.\n\n\u200B\n\nLet\u0027s get to it!\n",
