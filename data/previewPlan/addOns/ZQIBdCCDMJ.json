  "description": "#### **Special Focus: Posterior Chain Level 3**\n\nThis six week training plan is specifically designed to improve strength and mobility through the shoulders, back, glutes and hamstrings. With three short focused sessions per week, this is an ideal way to activate your posterior chain, an area typically overlooked with endurance athletes. You can add this plan as an off-season block or as an extra bump to your regular season training.\n\n\u200B\n\nLevel 3 is for the athlete who recently completed Level 2 or coming back from a one to\n\nthree month lay-off. This is also the level for those transitioning from the\n\ngym to body weight workouts. As with any of the SYSTM strength plans, take your\n\ntime with each session and follow the proper progression to reap the strength benefits.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis plan may be applied in conjunction with other Special Focused strength plans, such as Upper Body. However, If you choose to apply concurrent plans we suggest that you do so during the off-season or at a time when your endurance training volume is low.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe Special Focus stand alone plans follow a 2:1 progression and have three sessions per week on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.\n\n\u200B\n\nLet\u0027s get busy!\n",
