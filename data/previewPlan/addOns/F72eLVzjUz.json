This includes everything from your powerful glutes, hamstrings, and calves to the postural muscles of your upper back and neck._\n\n\u200B\n\nYour posterior chain is responsible for back and hip extension as well as knee flexion. It is vital in maintaining optimal posture during cycling and running in addition to water position in swimming. In this first session, we introduce some basic movements that focus on the activation and stabilization of posterior chain muscles. These moves include a combination of eccentric (lengthening), concentric (shortening), and isometric (holding) contractions. They provide your body with the foundation for more demanding moves to come. This is also a good session to come back to if you feel like you could use a quick posterior chain activation or tune-up.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?

          "description": "This session is designed to keep your body familiar with the basic movements of strength training without adding any extra fatigue to your system. This keeps your body adapted while allowing it to fully recover. To make the most out of your strength gains, you need to balance the hard work with adequate recovery. Given how short this session is, we strongly recommend completing a supplementary Yoga Session after this video. Something like Improving Posture, Shake Off the Day or Recovery Booster would be perfect.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Exercises Included**\n\n- Kneeling Hip Drive with Hands Over Head\n- Kneeling Hip Drive with Hips Side to Side\n- High Plank to Pigeon Pose\n- Plank with Leg Lifts\n- Hip Bridge with Reps\n- Fast Lateral Lunges with Knees Up\n- Standing Hip Drive with Hands Up\n- Standing Hip Drive with Hands Side to Side\n",
