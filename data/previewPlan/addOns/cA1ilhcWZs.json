  "description": "#### **Special Focus: Dynamic Level 5**\n\nThe six week Dynamic Focus plan is specifically designed to charge up your neuromuscular system, improve coordination, lateral stability and explosiveness to help you become a more efficient and resilient athlete. The three sessions each week will include integrated full body movements that require timing, coordination and strength as well as yoga sessions that will help you improve mobility and flexibility. As always, it is important to follow the progression with the Dynamic series in order to allow for adequate tissue adaptation.\n\n\u200B\n\nWe recommend that you only select Level 5 if you have recently completed Special Focus Dynamic Level 4. As with any of the SYSTM strength plans, take your time with each session and follow the proper progression.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis plan may be applied in conjunction with other Special Focused strength plans, such as Upper Body or Core Focus but is not recommended in conjunction with Lower Body Focus. If you choose to apply concurrent plans we suggest that you do so during the off-season or at a time when your endurance training volume is low.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe Special Focus stand alone plans follow a 2:1 progression and have three sessions per week on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.\n\n\u200B\n\nLet\u0027s get moving!\n",

The session begins with a calming breathing technique, followed by a simple foot massage to introduce movement from the toes up to the heel. With increased range of motion, the routine progresses to gentle, dynamic stretches for the calves, hamstrings, and hips. Since feet are often neglected and subjected to high demands from activities like running or cycling, practicing this sequence at least once a week helps to rebalance and address this issue.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe objectives are to improve mobility in the feet and ankles, stretch the calves and hamstrings, and open up the hips.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Poses in this session:**\n\n- Easy Seat\n- Box Breathing\n- Foot Massage\n- Downward Dog\n- Screaming Toe\n- Yoga Squat\n- Ankle Stretch\n- Ankle Mobilisations\n- Windscreen Wipers\n",

The session begins with a calming breathing technique, followed by a simple foot massage to introduce movement from the toes up to the heel. With increased range of motion, the routine progresses to gentle, dynamic stretches for the calves, hamstrings, and hips. Since feet are often neglected and subjected to high demands from activities like running or cycling, practicing this sequence at least once a week helps to rebalance and address this issue.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe objectives are to improve mobility in the feet and ankles, stretch the calves and hamstrings, and open up the hips.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Poses in this session:**\n\n- Easy Seat\n- Box Breathing\n- Foot Massage\n- Downward Dog\n- Screaming Toe\n- Yoga Squat\n- Ankle Stretch\n- Ankle Mobilisations\n- Windscreen Wipers\n",

          "description": "In this restorative sequence, the focus is on mobilizing the toes, feet, and ankles, stretching the calves and hamstrings, and opening up the hips. The session begins with a calming breathing technique, followed by a simple foot massage to introduce movement from the toes up to the heel. With increased range of motion, the routine progresses to gentle, dynamic stretches for the calves, hamstrings, and hips. Since feet are often neglected and subjected to high demands from activities like running or cycling, practicing this sequence at least once a week helps to rebalance and address this issue.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe objectives are to improve mobility in the feet and ankles, stretch the calves and hamstrings, and open up the hips.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Poses in this session:**\n\n- Easy Seat\n- Box Breathing\n- Foot Massage\n- Downward Dog\n- Screaming Toe\n- Yoga Squat\n- Ankle Stretch\n- Ankle Mobilisations\n- Windscreen Wipers\n",
