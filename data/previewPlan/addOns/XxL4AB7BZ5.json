It introduces the most basic versions of moves that make up the majority of this program. Some of these moves may seem very basic but we encourage you to focus on perfect form and execution during these early levels so that when we turn up the heat you have things nailed. As you\u0027ll see, all the exercises at the lower levels will progress in a similar fashion going forward. We\u0027re building strength, but also fine-tuning your nervous system. As the program progresses you\u0027ll be asked to complete more difficult variations on each foundational move.\n\n\u200B\n\nAs with all the strength training routines, it helps if you\u2019ve done a warm-up before getting started.

You might see these sessions as too short and too easy to be beneficial, but just like a proper recovery spin, active recovery is infinitely better than doing nothing at all. Given how short this session is, we strongly recommend also doing a Yoga Session in the app first. Something like Mobilize and Activate, Balance and Agility, or Full Body Mobilization.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Exercises Included**\n\n- Kneeling Hip Drive with Hands Up\n- Kneeling Hip Drive with Hands to Side\n- High Plank\n- Plank\n- Hip Bridge\n- Bent Leg Tip at the Hip\n- Standing Hip Drive with Hands Up\n- Standing Hip Drive with Hands to Side\n",
