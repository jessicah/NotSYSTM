  "description": "#### Special Focus: Upper Body Level 3\n\nThis six week training plan is specifically designed to improve your upper body strength and mobility that is often overlooked in endurance athletes. If you are currently in an off-season build or a mid-season bump, with three short focused sessions per week, this plan is ideal.  The combination of strength and yoga sessions will target your shoulders, chest, arms, upper back, and core muscles to help you become a well rounded athlete.\n\n\u200B\n\nLevel 3 is for the athlete who recently completed Level 2 or coming back from a one to three month lay-off. This is also the level for those transitioning from the gym to body weight workouts. As with any of the SYSTM strength plans, take your time with each session and follow the proper progression to reap the strength and mobility benefits.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis plan may be applied in conjunction with other Special Focused strength plans, such as Dynamic Focus or combined with one of the 12 week strength add-ons. However, If you choose to apply concurrent plans we suggest that you do so during the off-season or at a time when your endurance training volume is low.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe Special Focus stand alone plans follow a 2:1 progression and have three sessions per week on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.\n\n\u200B\n\nLet\u0027s do it!\n",

Level 4 will not disappoint in terms of overloading your chest, back, shoulders, arms, and core. Among other challenges, this workout includes two new tempo repetitions and work with resistance bands. The tempo training increases muscle activity as you react to sudden starts and stops while the resistance bands demand consistent focus with tension in all directions.
