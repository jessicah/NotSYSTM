With a substantial progression, there\u2019s enough here to keep you busy -- and improving -- for a very long time._\n\n\u200B\n\nThis is the first routine in the Full Body series. It introduces the most basic versions of moves that make up the majority of this program. Some of these moves may seem very basic but we encourage you to focus on perfect form and execution during these early levels so that when we turn up the heat you have things nailed. As you\u0027ll see, all the exercises at the lower levels will progress in a similar fashion going forward. We\u0027re building strength, but also fine-tuning your nervous system. As the program progresses you\u0027ll be asked to complete more difficult variations on each foundational move.\n\n\u200B\n\nAs with all the strength training routines, it helps if you\u2019ve done a warm-up before getting started. That can be one of your favorite yoga routines, riding your bike on the trainer for 5-10 minutes, or doing a personal stretching routine.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?

It introduces the most basic versions of moves that make up the majority of this program. Some of these moves may seem very basic but we encourage you to focus on perfect form and execution during these early levels so that when we turn up the heat you have things nailed. As you\u0027ll see, all the exercises at the lower levels will progress in a similar fashion going forward. We\u0027re building strength, but also fine-tuning your nervous system. As the program progresses you\u0027ll be asked to complete more difficult variations on each foundational move.\n\n\u200B\n\nAs with all the strength training routines, it helps if you\u2019ve done a warm-up before getting started.

We\u2019ll also focus on improving mobility, stability, and flexibility in the upper body. So get ready for great body-weight-based routines that focus on quality repetitions, endurance holds, and range of motion challenges._\n\n\u200B\n\nAs the first session in this series, we\u2019re going to introduce you to some basic upper body movements. This sequence will be beneficial for endurance sports where you need some upper body strength and improved posture, such as swimming, cycling (especially MTB and Cyclocross), and running. To help ensure overall strength, this routine incorporates some core muscle exercises and you may find some portions of the sequence difficult. No problem! Take your time to understand the movement. Pause the video if you need to and embrace the process of mastering new exercises.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?
