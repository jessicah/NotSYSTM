It is vital in maintaining optimal posture during cycling and running in addition to water position in swimming. In this first session, we introduce some basic movements that focus on the activation and stabilization of posterior chain muscles. These moves include a combination of eccentric (lengthening), concentric (shortening), and isometric (holding) contractions. They provide your body with the foundation for more demanding moves to come. This is also a good session to come back to if you feel like you could use a quick posterior chain activation or tune-up.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?

These moves include a combination of eccentric (lengthening), concentric (shortening), and isometric (holding) contractions.

So get ready for great body-weight-based routines that focus on quality repetitions, endurance holds, and range of motion challenges._\n\n\u200B\n\nAs the first session in this series, we\u2019re going to introduce you to some basic upper body movements. This sequence will be beneficial for endurance sports where you need some upper body strength and improved posture, such as swimming, cycling (especially MTB and Cyclocross), and running. To help ensure overall strength, this routine incorporates some core muscle exercises and you may find some portions of the sequence difficult. No problem! Take your time to understand the movement. Pause the video if you need to and embrace the process of mastering new exercises.\n\n\u200B\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?
