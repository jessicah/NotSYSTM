While it\u0027s not as comprehensive or as accurate as our main fitness test, _Full Frontal_, it\u0027s far more approachable and easier to pace for new riders. It also doesn\u0027t require any special preparation. You just need to feel relatively fresh.\n\n\u200B\n\nBased on more than a year of research (and after dozens of lab tests and thousands of online tests) and using sophisticated analysis of power and heart rate data, _Half Monty_ is far more accurate and comprehensive than standard ramp tests.\n\n\u200B\n\nIt also tells you more about who you are as an athlete. _Half Monty_ provides you with your FTP, Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP), and Cycling Threshold Heart Rate (cTHR), all of which we use to personalize your workout targets.\n\n\u200B\n\nIf you\u0027re still using the 4DP estimates when you set up your account, _Half Monty_ will also refine your AC and NM estimates (but will not do so if you\u0027ve done _Full Frontal_ or manually adjusted your estimates). If you want fully accurate AC and NM, as well as your Rider Type, Strengths, Weaknesses, and training plans adjusted to those Strengths and Weaknesses, you\u0027ll need to expose yourself to the _Full Frontal_ 4DP fitness test.\n\n\u200B\n\nReady to climb the ramp? You\u0027ll need the following before you start:\n\n- A heart rate monitor if you want the most accurate results. Don\u0027t have one? Order one [HERE](https://wahoofitness.com/devices)\n- Some kind of power device connected (trainer, power meter, virtual power, etc.)\n- Be ready to pay close attention to the instructions in the workout\n- Be sure your profile is complete and up-to-date (Profile \u003E About You). Accurate information helps us make our calculations\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to \u0027[Why Fitness Testing Matters](https://the-knowledge-by-wahoo-sports-science.simplecast.com/episodes/testing-testing-1-2-3-why-fitness-testing-matters)\u0027 on The Knowledge Podcast by Wahoo Sports Science.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s some more information on how to get the most from your fitness test.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterFitnessAssessment)\n",

Only the alternative, curious and brave plan their journeys in this hidden gem. However, a small self-organized crew from Serbia and Germany set a mission to discover and reveal those stunning natural creations of Serbia. On a bicycle. In just five days, they traversed 450 kilometers across six mountains of Western Serbia, and climbed around 11,000 meters to film and produce what you are about to experience.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: The workout accompanying this film is a recovery session.

The intensity and cadence targets will vary throughout this session to keep it interesting, but not so much that it distracts you from the story.\n",

              "description": "The goal of this workout is to help develop your baseline aerobic fitness. While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high and your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week. Shorter Endurance rides (like this one) can fit in both a hard week of training and a recovery week. That is, only if you do it right! Most people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022\n\n\u200B\n\nTruth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride, especially one under 90 minutes should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted.\n\nSo what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like? For 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70%, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in low to mid Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can; for most this is 80-90rpm. Also, your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster, but you will have to trust us on this one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions, or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: 4\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nNA\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

This is a great workout to help build your fitness for sustained and repeating climbing efforts up steep mountains.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 1 -- 40% of FTP-- HR \u003C70%\n\n45 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 6 -- 90% of FTP -- HR \u003C100\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 4 -- 70% of FTP -- HR \u003C90\n\n45 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n15 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 150% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n45 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n15 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 180% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n1 minute 30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of Sets: 4 sets, all unique\n\nRest Between Sets: N/A\n\n**Set 1:**\n\nEffort 1: 8 minutes @ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR \u003C95%\n\nRecovery 1: 1 minute @ RPE 1 -- 40% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nRecovery 2: 2 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nRecovery 3: 1 minutes @ RPE2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n**Set 2:**\n\nEffort 1: 8 minutes @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR \u003C95%\n\nRecovery 1: 1 minute @ RPE 1 -- 40% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nRecovery 2: 2 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nRecovery 3: 1 minutes @ RPE2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n**Set 3:**\n\nEffort 1: 8 minutes @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C95%\n\nRecovery 1: 1 minute @ RPE 1 -- 40% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nRecovery 2: 2 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nRecovery 3: 1 minutes @ RPE2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n**Set 4:**\n\nEffort 1: 8 minutes @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR \u003C95%\n\nRecovery 1: 1 minute @ RPE 1 -- 40% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nRecovery 2: 2 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nRecovery 3: 1 minutes @ RPE2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume **\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n3 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE1 -- 40% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n45 seconds @ RPE 1 -- 35% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are just times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right!\n\n\u200B\n\nMost people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022 Truth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted. So what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like?\n\nFor 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70% is ok, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm and your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster. You will have to trust us on that one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions!

              "description": "One of the best sessions for neuromuscular training, this drill asks you to progressively build from a cadence of 90 RPM to your MAX over 30 seconds, recover, and repeat several times. Cadence builds improve how you recruit your leg, gluteal, and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke by progressing to your maximal cadence. By reaching your highest cadence possible, you are training the \u0027on/off\u0027 switch in each muscle group to not only work faster but to have less overlap with your other muscle groups. This session trains your hamstring muscles to \u0027turn off\u0027 when your quads \u0027turn on\u0027 and vice-versa, resulting in a more efficient pedal stroke at both high and low cadences.\n\n\u200B\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to The Knowledge podcast, by Wahoo Sports Science - The Benefits of High Cadence Training: [https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence](https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence)\n",

This one may be short but it\u2019ll have you hanging onto the edge of your saddle as we explore the Pilancones Natural Park, high up on a mountain ridge overlooking the Soria valley as we head towards Chira Lake. The goal of this ride will be to work on your good form with a slightly higher cadence than normal, keeping the legs supple and spinning. We\u2019ll gently build the effort up a 3km climb to get the heart, legs and lungs working a little harder before descending to our final destination at Chira Lake. This workout is perfect for those days when you need an easier session or want to activate the body before going deeper.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis workout focusses on a progressive build through the duration of the climb helping with your pacing skills and sustained efforts.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/8773915186)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

              "description": "The training benefit of this session comes down to the uncomfortably high cadence you need to hold during each effort. Even though these efforts are under FTP, the high leg speed required will leave your system working harder than usual for the required power output.\n\nBy maintaining the highest cadence possible (without bouncing in the saddle) you end up pushing your neuromuscular coordination near its limits in a similar way to Cadence Builds.\n\n\u200B\n\nWith an emphasis on low torque (high RPM) efforts this session is polar opposite to sessions like GOAT and Power Station. Even though these efforts are short and below FTP the high cadence places more of a load on your cardiovascular system, so expect your heart rate and breathing to be higher than normal for the power.\n\n\u200B\n\nSince muscles can only contract (pull) any given muscle will primarily move a joint in a single direction. When it comes to pedaling a bike, your quads and glutes can push the pedals down, while your hamstrings and hip flexors pull the pedals back up (with the help of your glutes and quads on the other leg). If you were to pedal with one leg (as you do in Cadence Drills) and your hamstrings and glutes were unable to contract, once you get to the bottom of the pedal stroke your leg would be stuck down there. No matter how hard you might try, your glutes and quads will do nothing to help you get that pedal all the way around. Suppose you do have both feet clipped in, and you are letting your opposite leg push down to bring your leg back up to 12 o\u0027clock. If your quads and glutes are still contracting (pushing the pedal down) while the glutes and quads of your other leg are starting to push their pedal down, you will end up with one leg working against the other. You must relax the glutes and quads of one leg to get all of the power out of the glutes and quads of your other leg.\n\nThis is where neuromuscular coordination comes into play. During each pedal revolution, your legs have to \u201Cswitch on\u201D and \u201Cswitch off\u201D almost all of the muscles in your legs. By maintaining your highest cadence without bouncing, you are pushing all of the muscles in each leg to contract and relax (switch on and off) as quickly as possible.\n\nWhile we give specific cadence targets in this session, everyone has a different limit to what cadence they can maintain before bouncing in the saddle. To get the intended benefit of this session you need to maintain the power targets at the highest cadence that YOU can maintain. For some that might be 105RPM, for others, it might be 150RPM. What matters is that you push YOUR neuromuscular system to its limits.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n15 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of sets: 3\n\nRest between sets: 7 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nInterval repeats per: NA\n\n**Interval**\n\n3 minutes @ RPE 5 -- 80% of FTP -- 100\u002B RPM -- HR \u003C95%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

For 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70%, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in low to mid Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can; for most this is 80-90rpm. Also, your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster, but you will have to trust us on this one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions, or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: 2\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nNA\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

We\u2019ll kick off the climb with a 4-minute low cadence interval at 80-85% FTP, followed by a 2-minute recovery. From there, each interval shortens by one minute, while the cadence and effort increase slightly, alternating between low and high cadence to maintain focus and form.\n\nOnce we reach the summit, it\u2019s time to recover briefly before diving into the second part of the session: five 60-second tempo-to-threshold builds on the flat toward Haldensee. This workout is designed to improve aerobic efficiency, strength, and your ability to recover between hard efforts. Sounds simple? Let\u2019s chat at the end\u2014good luck!\n\n\u200B\n\nThe intervals will alternate between low and high cadence requiring you to ride at an exceptionally low cadence to stress your muscular system more than your cardiovascular system and then riding at 100\u002B RPM has the exact opposite effect with less strain on your muscles, but a greater strain on your cardiovascular system. Alternating back and forth between low and high cadence will ensure both your muscular system and cardiovascular system get pushed hard.\n\nThe tempo builds will work you hard but flush out your legs making your recovery quicker so you can go hard tomorrow.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/9853644571)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are just times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right! Most people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022\n\n\u200B\n\nTruth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted. So what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like? For 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70% is ok, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm. Also, your RPE should be a 2-4.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster. You will have to trust us on that one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions! Or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 7\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 1\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C85%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

The blend between mind and body, working together to overcome hard moments\u2014be it physical, mental or emotional\u2014and how we learn to cope in our own mind is essential in being able to process the past, be true to ourselves in the present, and create moments of inner peace in the future.\n\n\u200B\n\nA decade after crossing the French Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es non-stop on a ride that would act as a catalyst for change, I wanted to share this story for the first time. To give an insight into the deeper meaning behind some of the mountain challenges you may have seen me undertake over the years, I felt now was the time to head back to my mountains, return to source, and embrace the unknown.\n\n\u200B\n\nOvercoming the mountains of our mind, from escapism to reconnection. 10 years, 10 cols and 10,000 meters of climbing. This is my story of going Full Circle.\n\n\u200B\n\nThank you for watching. I truly hope there is something in this video that can help you in your own journey.\n\n\u200B\n\nPeace,\n\nMike Cotty\u0022\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: The workout accompanying this film is a recovery session, which is a very low-intensity ride. It\u0027s so easy that your power remains at or below 50% of FTP or an RPE less than 2.5, and your heart rate stays in zone 1 the entire time. The intensity and cadence targets will vary throughout this session to keep it interesting (But not so interesting that you can\u0027t pay attention to the film).\n",

Not only is this a great workout physiologically, but it\u0027s also great for learning how to ride a negative split.\n\n\u200B\n\nWhen we talk about a \u0022negative split\u0022 we mean completing the second half of an effort at a higher speed/power than the first half. While the first few of these might not feel so bad, the repetition and 1:1 work to recovery will ensure your heart rate and breathing stay elevated for the second half.\n\n\u200B\n\nAs you complete each effort, holding 100% of FTP will feel harder and harder. This in itself is excellent mental practice for \u0022feeling\u0022 how your RPE for the same power can drift up as fatigue sets in. Knowing what 100% of FTP feels like when your legs are nearly spent is a great reminder of why starting an effort too hard will bite you in the end.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis dishes out a respectable 24-minutes of intensity. The fact that your heart and lungs are already pumping at high output when you start each MAP effort maximizes the gain you\u0027ll get from those 8-minutes at 100% of MAP.\n\n\u200B\n\nRegardless of your chosen discipline or event, this is a session that will benefit everyone, both regarding learning good pacing and giving your aerobic system a big training boost.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n2 minutes 30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR \u003C100\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort** x8\n\nEffort 1: 2 minutes @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\nEffort 2: 1 minutes @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%%\n\nRest: 3 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minute @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR \u003C70%\n",

              "description": "While the single tempo effort you complete in this session is steady in terms of power, it is the specific cadence targets that set this session apart from other tempo workouts.\n\n\u200B\n\nEven though an effort at 80% of FTP might seem \u0022easy\u0022 the truth is your body is working at processing oxygen and metabolites at nearly the same rate when you are right at FTP. The difference is that the overall stress on your system when riding tempo is considerably less than riding at FTP. That means you can either have harder days before or after a tempo session (compared to a Threshold session) or you can increase the duration of those tempo efforts to make the overall training stimulus equal (or greater) than completing several repeats right at your FTP.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis tempo effort is divided into 3 segments of equal duration. While the power is the same across all segments, your target cadence starts out low and increases with each new segment from 65rpm, 75rpm and finally 95rpm. Starting with a long block of low cadence should fatigue your muscles from the start of your effort. As the effort builds and you create more fatigue, the increased cadence targets will place a greater demand on your cardiovascular system. That will, in some way, feel like a nice break given the load you have been putting on your muscular system. The cadence targets in the final segment will force your fatigued muscles to maintain good coordination as the faster cadence requires your muscles to switch \u0022on\u0022 and \u0022off\u0022 at a faster rate. Between the low rpm sections, and the high rpm work under fatigue, this tempo session not only helps train your FTP, but it has a training benefit to your neuromuscular system.\n\n\u200B\n\nYou can expect your Heart Rate to remain low for the power targets during the low cadence segment at the start. As the effort progresses and you reach the final 10 minutes of the high rpm segment your heart rate might go over Z3, which is not something to worry about. While this session appears \u0022easy\u0022 at first glance, don\u0027t be surprised if your legs are feeling it the next day.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n25 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 8 -- 105% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of sets: 3\n\nRest between sets: NA\n\nInterval repeats per: NA\n\n**Interval**\n\nBuild 1: 25 minutes @ RPE 5 -- 80% of FTP -- HR \u003C80% at 65rpm\n\nBuild 2: 25 minutes @ RPE 5 -- 80% of FTP -- HR \u003C80% at 75rpm\n\nBuild 3: 25 minutes @ RPE 5 -- 80% of FTP -- HR \u003C80% at 95rpm\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

              "description": "Meandering along the scenic River Iller, it\u2019s time to break out your gravel bike for a classic cadence build and hold session. We\u2019ll kick off with 5 x 30-second cadence builds, allowing for 2 minutes of recovery between each, before moving on to 5 x 60-second cadence holds, again with 2 minutes recovery.\n\nWhile this session may be short, it\u2019s a key part of your weekly plan, designed to keep you efficient and in top form, even when the cadence ramps up. Stay smooth and steady\u2014and remember, \u201Cno bobbing!\u201D\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Builds:** The name of the game here is absolute peak cadence, not peak power. To achieve this, you need to be in a small gear and have very light resistance. Starting at 90-RPM, steadily increase your cadence until you reach your absolute max with about 5-seconds left, and hold that to the end. Your limiting factor on these efforts needs to be leg speed. If resistance/power output is your limiting factor, try starting in an easier gear, or shift into an easier gear 15-seconds in. Bouncing in the saddle is okay for this drill.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Holds**: These efforts require you to maintain the highest cadence you can without starting to bounce in the saddle. For some of you that will be 100-RPM, for others, it will be 150-RPM. The key is to settle into YOUR peak sustainable cadence. Like the Builds, the goal here is not high power, so these efforts are limited to 90% of FTP. Do not be surprised if your heart rate is well into Zone 4 by the time you hit the last few holds.\n\n\nTo properly execute this session, your effort between drills needs to be low. With limited recovery time between these maximal Neuromuscular Efforts, riding above Zone 1 between efforts will only reduce your ability to max out your cadence. While the power targets between are Zone 1, do not be surprised if your heart rate does not drop below Zone 2 after the first couple builds.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/9885886076)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high and your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week. Shorter Endurance rides (like this one) can fit in both a hard week of training and a recovery week. That is, only if you do it right! Most people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022\n\n\u200B\n\nTruth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride, especially one under 90 minutes should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted.\n\nSo what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like? For 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70%, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in low to mid Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can; for most this is 80-90rpm. Also, your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster, but you will have to trust us on this one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions, or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: 2\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nNA\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are just times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right!\n\n\u200B\n\nMost people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022 Truth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted. So what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like?\n\nFor 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70% is ok, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm and your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster. You will have to trust us on that one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions! Or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\nWarm-Up\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\nMain Effort\n\nNumber of Sets\n\n5\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set\n\n1\n\nInterval: 10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n\u200B\n\nExtra Volume\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\nCool Down\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

Add in the standing starts for the Individual Pursuit and Kilo, and you give your NM a real run-through. The repeated surges of the Elimination Race, the all-out nature of the Kilo, and the massive efforts you have to make in the points race really test your powers of recovery while working your AC all the way to the max.\n\n\u200B\n\nSince the efforts come in quick succession, and with most being over four minutes in length, your cardiovascular system never catches a real break, ensuring your MAP doesn\u2019t get left out of the equation.\n",

Click [\u002B\u002Bhere\u002B\u002B](https://wahoox.forum.wahoofitness.com/t/wahoo-november-challenge-groundwork/30430) to find out more.\n\n\u200B\n\nWouldn\u0027t it be great if you could leave work to go for a ride? Even for an hour? Well, now\u0027s your chance. _Getting Away With It_ gets you out of the office and onto the roads of the French Pyrenees with your guide Michael Cotty of The Col Collective.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis is a great session to add toward the end of a training block. The shorter duration, sub-threshold efforts are fantastic for getting some extra FTP building while you are in a fatigued state. Extra emphasis on cadence stresses your nervous system, making your body more efficient at higher and lower RPMs while improving your form. The Neuromuscular training you get from this session is fantastic, so while your power never exceeds threshold, your body will learn to bring more energy to the pedals at all intensities.\n",

While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are just times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right!\n\n\u200B\n\nMost people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022 Truth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted. So what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like?\n\nFor 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70% is ok, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm and your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster. You will have to trust us on that one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions! Or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\nWarm-Up\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\nMain Effort\n\nNumber of Sets\n\n5\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set\n\n1\n\nInterval: 10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n\u200B\n\nExtra Volume\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\nCool Down\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

              "description": "This is a session that you\u0027ll want to complete in Level, rather than Erg, mode. The only time we would suggest Erg mode is if you are unable to maintain the lower power targets set between sprints.\n\nWith short maximal sprint efforts, you\u0027ll recruit every muscle fiber you have in your legs with each effort. While cadence builds force your muscles to contract and relax as quickly as possible, this session forces your muscles to contract with maximal force. Just like cadence builds this session becomes one of the best ways to train your neuromuscular system. Even if your target event does not require you to complete maximal sprints, there is a substantial trickle-down effect to the longer duration power efforts when you train your neuromuscular system.\n\nThis session is a great alternate to cadence builds or standing starts for those completing our SUF Strength sessions. On days you complete off the bike strength work you want your on bike training to complement the suffering you put yourself through off the bike. That means short maximal efforts (whether for power or for cadence) are the best workouts to complement the strength gains you\u0027ve made off the bike.\n\nAs long as you run this session in slope mode you can complete the sprints either seated or out of the saddle. For those competing in events that do not require much (if any) standing (such as Time Trials or Triathlons) you should complete these sprints seated (and in the aerobars or drops if that is where you are racing).\n\nYou should also do these efforts seated if you don\u0027t feel an out-of-the-saddle maximal sprint is stable/safe to do on your trainer. Regardless of using ERG or Slope mode, you do not want to hold anything back on any sprint. Seeing your peak power drop as the session goes on is totally normal as your legs fatigue. This is where RPE really becomes the most important metric, rather than power, heart rate, or cadence.\n\nNow get on that bike and CRUSH IT!\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of sets: 12\n\nRest between sets: 9 minutes 50 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nInterval repeats per set: NA\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 200% of FTP -- \u003E105%\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

The first two drills, Cadence Holds and Builds, are designed to improve the way you recruit your leg, glute and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke. They do this by forcing you to sustain a cadence just above \u0027comfortable\u0027 and by pushing you to your maximal cadence.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe last drill, Single Leg Efforts, ask you to unclip one leg and ride at a steady, single-legged effort. This forces you to pull up on the pedal instead of just pushing down and ensures maximal muscle awareness and engagement. This workout is best done while riding indoors on a trainer because even small variations in terrain can affect your ability to properly execute this workout. The majority of this workout is done in heart rate Z1/2 /// 50-75% of threshold /// RPE 2-5. You should keep the effort level below threshold (heart rate Z4, 100% of threshold, RPE 7-8) during the max cadence efforts.\n\n\u200B\n\nWORKOUT GOALS:\n\n- To improve stillness and stability at high cadences.\n- To improve muscle fiber engagement for improved efficiency at all cadences.\n- To increase maximum cadence.\n- To make that pedal stroke as smooth as butter.\n\nCADENCE TARGETS:\n\n- Warm-up 80-90rpm\n- Build: 90-150rpm\n- Hold: 115rpm\n- Single Leg: 85rpm\n\nListen to The Knowledge podcast, by Wahoo Sports Science - The Benefits of High Cadence Training: [https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence](https://wahoosystm.com/BenefitsofHighCadence)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n3 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 3\n\nRest Between Sets: 8 minutes @ RPE 23 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: N/A\n\n**Interval**\n\nCadence Build: 30 seconds @ RPE 8 -- Starting at 90RPM Build to Max RPM -- Max Power is NOT Goal\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nCadence Hold: 45 seconds @ RPE 7.5 -- \u003C100% FTP -- Highest RPM you can hold without Bouncing\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nSingle Leg: 1 minute @ RPE 6 -- Single Leg Only -- \u003C50% of FTP\n\nRecovery: 1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nSingle Leg: 1 minute @ RPE 6 -- Single Leg Only, Opposite Leg -- \u003C50% of FTP (100% of FTP with both legs = 50% of FTP\n\nwith one leg)\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n8 minutes 15 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

              "description": "The goal of this workout is to help develop your baseline aerobic fitness. While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high and your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week. Shorter Endurance rides (like this one) can fit in both a hard week of training and a recovery week. That is, only if you do it right! Most people ride too hard when they head out for their \u0022base miles.\u0022\n\n\u200B\n\nTruth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride, especially one under 90 minutes should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted.\n\nSo what does a \u0022proper\u0022 Zone 2 ride look like? For 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70%, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in low to mid Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can; for most this is 80-90rpm. Also, your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200B\n\nSounds simple right? It\u0027s actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster, but you will have to trust us on this one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions, or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: 2\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nNA\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

You\u2019ll start with a flat warm-up to get the body ready before diving into a progressive series of ramping intervals. Each interval gets shorter but more intense, pushing your cardiovascular system while keeping your legs working under control. The aim is to help you finish strong \u2014 not fade \u2014 by learning how to pace properly through effort buildup.\n\n\u200B\n\nSet on the steady slopes of Coll de Rates, the consistent gradient supports rhythm and control, allowing you to focus on cadence, breathing, and technique as you go deeper into the red. The final threshold block adds bonus training stimulus and flushes the legs under fatigue.

This continuous tempo effort will have you alternate between 75 \u0026 85% of FTP every minute. Not only does this help pass the time rather quickly, it will help improve your aerobic fitness. Time spent in this intensity range will help increase your stroke volume (amount of blood your heart can pump every minute), your lactate threshold, and the mitochondrial density of your muscles (mitochondria are the \u0022power houses\u0022 of the cells that create energy). All of these things are very important parts of aerobic metabolism and performing your best- especially if you like group rides. This is the typical intensity range that most group rides fall into- not a leisurely pace, but not so fast that people are falling off the back within minutes. So if you find that you commonly struggle with group rides, gradually spending more time on workouts at this intensity will have you holding on longer and taking your pulls without missing a beat!\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n6 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n4 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of sets: 10\n\nRest between sets: NA\n\nInterval repeats per: NA\n\n**Interval**\n\nWork: 1 minute @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR \u003C100\n\nSteady: 1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

              "description": "If you want a do-it-all session that will maintain and improve nearly every aspect of your fitness, _The Chores_ is just the ticket. This workout features 3 sets of intervals. Each set combines a series of 40-second efforts with 20-second recoveries, followed by an immediate transition to a sustained effort just below threshold. These short efforts with minimal recovery deplete your anaerobic gas tank, forcing your body to get better at producing power aerobically. This combination will help improve your Anaerobic Capacity, (AC) your Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP), and your Functional Threshold Power (FTP), all in just under an hour.\n\n\u200B\n\nAt the start of each set, your body starts to dip into your anaerobic reserves to help hit the high-power targets. Your body then starts to ramp up your oxygen intake in order to produce more of the power requirements aerobically. With such short recovery time between these efforts, your AC is steadily drained through each set. By the time the last short interval arrives, your body will be forced to produce almost all of that power aerobically, which will push your lungs to their very limit.\n\n\u200B\n\nThis is the optimal time to stress your body\u2019s ability to produce power at threshold. With your AC depleted (and your lungs and heart working near maximal capacity), the shorter sustained efforts that would normally be a piece of cake will have a bit more...sting. No matter what your preferred discipline, terrain, or distance, this session will make you fitter and faster.\n\n\u200B\n\nFeaturing exciting, on-bike camera footage from the Velon Hammer Series, _The Chores_ will make you earn your keep.\n",

Your bodies ability to clear out metabolites and process oxygen is nearly identical between 90% of FTP and 100% of FTP, the difference is that at 100% of FTP your body is producing those metabolites at the same rate it is clearing them. At 90% of FTP your body can clear things at the same rate, but your body isn\u0027t producing them at the same rate.\n\nLong Sub-Threshold efforts represent an effort that your body can just about handle (assuming you are properly fueled and not completely exhausted), clearing things out faster than they can accumulate. To really stress that clearance rate each of these Sub-Threshold efforts start with a 20-second effort well above FTP. By the time you settle into the Sub-Threshold effort, your body will be flooded with those metabolites that cause your legs and lungs to burn. However, since you are below FTP (clearing things out faster than you are producing them), the concentration of those metabolites will slowly drop over the course of the whole effort. Not only does this train your body to clear things faster, but it will also mentally prepare for the discomfort associated with efforts above FTP.\n\n\u200B\n\nFor this session, we are asking you to dance on that razor\u0027s edge of your FTP, ideally the side that allows you to complete the session. If your legs or lungs aren\u0027t feeling great, you are better off dropping the steady effort by 5% and keeping the starting effort at 100%. Another component of this is settling into a good rhythm of breathing and pedaling. Everyone has a preferred cadence, and this is an instance where your preferred cadence supersedes the cadence targets onscreen. We want you dancing right on that edge of your comfort, and you can get much closer to that edge riding your preferred cadence.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 5.5 -- 85% of FTP -- HR \u003C90%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n6 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of sets: 3\n\nRest between sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\nInterval repeats per set: NA\n\n**Interval**\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 9.5 -- 180% of FTP -- HR \u003E105%\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR \u003C100%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n25 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n4 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70%\n",

              "description": "Do you have Couchlandrian Tendencies? This short but powerful workout will cure you of that affliction and reassert your inner Sufferlandrian. The session is based on a combination of specific micro-intervals (made famous by Japanese coach and physiologist Izumi Tabata) that we combined with classic tempo efforts. This gives you a superb mix of Anaerobic Capacity (AC), Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP), and FTP training stresses in one short workout to help you go faster and stay stronger for longer.\n\n\u200B\n\nNow, for the sports science purists among you, the \u0027Tabata\u0027 intervals should actually be named \u0027Koichi\u0027 intervals, since it was Japanese speedskating coach Irisawa Koichi who first employed the use of the 20-seconds on / 10-seconds off intervals that Dr. Izumi then confirmed via physiology lab studies to yield the best mix of maximal aerobic and anaerobic stress among the different on/off protocols that he tested.\n\n\u200B\n\nFor this workout, we have toned down the original intensity of the Tabata intervals to target MAP rather than Anaerobic Capacity in order to be able to complete the 20/10 micro-intervals and then follow the short efforts immediately with sustained 80-100% of FTP intervals to replicate the kind of attack and then settle efforts that are common in cycling races.\n\n\u200B\n\nFrom a physiological perspective, you\u2019ll produce lots of lactate during the micro-intervals. Then the goal of the tempo and FTP efforts is to stress your body\u2019s capacity to clear that lactate as quickly as possible. Effectively, we\u2019re trying to maximize lactate \u0027flux.\u0027 For each successive round of the efforts, you\u2019ll do one less micro-interval, and the tempo efforts will get shorter. But because you\u2019re a Sufferlandrian, they won\u2019t get easier, and the rest between sets will get shorter. The intensity for the tempo efforts will ramp up with each repetition. Fortunately for you, there are only 3 sets of efforts and you\u2019ll be done in just 30 minutes. If you\u2019ve set aside an hour for this workout, you\u2019ll be happy to have those additional 30 minutes for recovery after this session.\n",

We\u2019ll kick off with 5 x 30-second cadence builds, allowing for 2 minutes of recovery between each, before moving on to 5 x 60-second cadence holds, again with 2 minutes recovery.\n\nWhile this session may be short, it\u2019s a key part of your weekly plan, designed to keep you efficient and in top form, even when the cadence ramps up. Stay smooth and steady\u2014and remember, \u201Cno bobbing!\u201D\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Builds:** The name of the game here is absolute peak cadence, not peak power. To achieve this, you need to be in a small gear and have very light resistance. Starting at 90-RPM, steadily increase your cadence until you reach your absolute max with about 5-seconds left, and hold that to the end. Your limiting factor on these efforts needs to be leg speed. If resistance/power output is your limiting factor, try starting in an easier gear, or shift into an easier gear 15-seconds in. Bouncing in the saddle is okay for this drill.\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cadence Holds**: These efforts require you to maintain the highest cadence you can without starting to bounce in the saddle. For some of you that will be 100-RPM, for others, it will be 150-RPM. The key is to settle into YOUR peak sustainable cadence. Like the Builds, the goal here is not high power, so these efforts are limited to 90% of FTP. Do not be surprised if your heart rate is well into Zone 4 by the time you hit the last few holds.\n\n\nTo properly execute this session, your effort between drills needs to be low. With limited recovery time between these maximal Neuromuscular Efforts, riding above Zone 1 between efforts will only reduce your ability to max out your cadence. While the power targets between are Zone 1, do not be surprised if your heart rate does not drop below Zone 2 after the first couple builds.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Route on Strava**](https://www.strava.com/activities/9885886076)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty.

But after 800km of cycling through the Alps from Nice to Mege\u0300ve, the cycling journalist and author realized that the experience had delivered to him and the 400-plus starters something far greater. It had provided them with the adventure of a lifetime; from a sense of what it would be like to ride in the fabled Tour de France that he has reported on more than 30 times, to the creation of friendships with fellow riders forged by their shared suffering and encouragement for one another as they cycled through some of the toughest and most spectacular mountains that cycling has to offer.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: This is a great way to watch a compelling documentary while developing your baseline aerobic fitness. The intensity of this workout will vary mostly between 60-70% of FTP, with heart rate remaining entirely in zone 2. This session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing.\n",

The term \u0022Taper\u0022 refers to how you train in the week or so before your target event to ensure you deliver your best performance. Generally, tapering means reducing your total training volume but continuing to hit some high-intensity efforts. While there are individual variations in the best way to taper, this session has been used by countless professionals leading into the biggest races of their lives -- athletes like World Champions Rohan Dennis and Flora Duffy.\n\n\u200B\n\nWith 3 sets of micro-intervals (40/20s, 30/30s, and 20/40s) you will hit your system with just enough intensity to keep your legs sharp and responsive, without adding any real fatigue. Outside of those 3 sets of micro-intervals, this session is purposefully short and easy. This is a preparation session, not a training session! After all, your event is just around the corner and all of the important training is behind you. Riding harder or longer today will do absolutely nothing to increase your fitness by event day; in fact, all that would do is increase your fatigue, which will only hurt your performance. Rather, this session makes sure your body is humming along and ready to perform on the big day.\n",
