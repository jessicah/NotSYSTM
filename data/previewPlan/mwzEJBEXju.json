              "description": "This session is all about high-torque efforts, very similar to the efforts you would experience riding up the steep slopes of Mt Sufferlandria. While these efforts are short and the intensity isn\u2019t too high, the low cadence targets combined with minimal recovery will leave some begging for the high-cadence sprints of _The Omnium_. High-torque efforts like these have two primary benefits: improved neuromuscular coordination and increased muscular endurance.\n\n\u200B\n\nDuring each pedal revolution, your legs have to \u201Cswitch on\u201D and \u201Cswitch off\u201D almost all of the muscles in your legs. High-cadence efforts in something like _Cadence Builds_ are great for teaching these groups to make that switch quickly. These low-cadence efforts are better for teaching ALL of the muscles in your legs to \u201Cswitch on.\u201D Done properly, you should be pulling with your hamstrings with one leg while the other leg is pushing down with all the force your glutes and quads can muster. If you feel like you are pushing yourself up out of the saddle during harder efforts (like seated sprints), your hamstrings are not being utilized since they should pull you back down into your saddle.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe second main benefit is improved muscular endurance. Even though the session is under 45 minutes, **you\u0027ll put a similar amount of muscular fatigue into your legs as a steady, multi-hour base ride.** You can almost view this session as hitting the leg press for 8 sets of 100 reps. And just like the weight room, proper form is absolutely key. That means:\n\n- You should focus on pushing down AND pulling back up. You want your glutes and quads activated on the way down and your hamstring and hip flexors activated on the way up.\n- To properly engage your hamstrings think about trying to pulling your heel up to your butt when your crank arm is going from 6 o\u2019clock to 10 o\u2019clock.\n- Your knees should be tracking straight up and down, no collapsing in or out.\n- Your core should be fully engaged to keep your hips steady in the saddle. This will be easier if you are both pushing and pulling during each pedal revolution.\n\nThis session is very similar to _Power Station_. Both help improve your muscular endurance and coordination; the biggest difference is the work to rest ratio between the two. While the intervals here are shorter than those in _Power Station_, the decreased recovery duration means fatigue will build faster, especially for those with a weakness in repeated efforts.\n\nModifying interval length and recovery duration can also be seen between sessions like _Revolver_ and _A Very Dark Place_. Both serve up a healthy dose of MAP/VO2 work, but the overall feeling of those two sessions is different.\n\nIf you find that your lower back starts to ache during this session or that you have to start rocking in the saddle to keep the power up, then it\u2019s time for you to get started on the SYSTM Yoga program. Kick it off with \u201CCore Strengtheners \u201D to make sure your core is just as strong as those legs.\n\n\u200B\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to \u0027[When to Train with Low Cadence](https://the-knowledge-by-wahoo-sports-science.simplecast.com/episodes/when-to-train-with-low-cadence)\u0027 on The Knowledge Podcast by Wahoo Sports Science.\n",

This session is similar to The Trick, with a few differences. On the plus side, all of the efforts are 15-seconds shorter than those in The Trick. To make up for this, we added two more intervals to this session, bringing the total to 6. That means by the end of this session you will have plowed through 4.5-minutes of AC work.\n\nThis workout is one of the few sessions that we do NOT recommend you complete in ERG mode if you are on a smart trainer. The goal is to hold onto the highest power you can for the full 45-seconds. Inevitably in the later sets, your power will dip before you reach the end of the interval. What we want is for you to complete every effort having given everything for 45-seconds. We don\u0027t want ERG mode grinding you to a halt because you cannot maintain the (ridiculously) high power targets. Even if you drop down below FTP in the final 10-seconds of these efforts, as long as you are going flat out, you are doing it correctly.\n\nJust take this session one interval at a time, and focus on giving your all for this one effort. You can worry about the others when you get to them. If you finish this session without swearing, then you didn\u0027t go hard enough!\n\n\u200B\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n1 minute 30 seconds @ RPE -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n\n1 minute 15 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 4 -- 70% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n\n45 seconds @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR \u003C90\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n\n15 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 120% of FTP -- HR \u003E105\n\n45 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n\n15 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 200% of FTP -- HR \u003E105\n\n1 minute 30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n\n\u200B\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 6\n\nRest Between Sets: 5 minutes 15 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: N/A\n\n**Interval**\n\nEffort: 45 seconds @ RPE 9.5 -- 150% of FTP -- HR \u003E105\n\n\u200B\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200B\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n4 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP -- HR \u003C70\n",

Then you settle into a controlled, below-FTP effort that will accelerate the rate at which you can clear lactate from your muscles. You\u0027ll finish each effort off with a big surge based on your Anaerobic Capacity (AC). In just 30 minutes, you\u0027ll be doing efforts targeting your sprint power, FTP, and AC for an exceptionally well-rounded workout.\n\n\u200B\n\nSupport the Wahooligan Tour by [donating to the Davis Phinney Foundation](https://secure2.convio.net/dpf/site/TR?pg=pfind\u0026fr_id=1391) and their programs to help people living with Parkinsons.\n",
