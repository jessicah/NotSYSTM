Continually undulating we\u2019ll hit each of the eight rolling climbs hard, working at low cadence with high intensity to build strength. Mike will keep you focused on good form, though, and make sure you keep the power down on all the way over each summit.\n\n\u200B\n\nIt wouldn\u0027t be an On Location ride, though, if we didn\u0027t have a look at the scenic attractions along the way, though, so get ready for craggy rocks, turquoise clear waters, and a few opportunities to delve into the Costa Brava\u2019s finest as we find out more about the region along this 21km route.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Route on Strava](https://www.strava.com/routes/2967787441439728434)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty. As founder of The Col Collective, Mike has made a career out of riding, filming, and telling the story of epic rides and mountains across the continent. As your On Location co-creator and host, Mike\u0027s engaging character, curious mind, and friendly nature will have you cueing up your next ride with him before you\u0027ve even finished the cool-down._\n",

For this session, each interval is 8-minutes in length, with 1-minute blocks at 95% of FTP (Under) and 1-minute blocks at 105% of FTP (Over).

They also explain why FTP is great for setting targets for recovery and endurance - but NOT for high-intensity work \u2014 and what understanding your FTP relative to your MAP, AC and NM tell you about your potential for improvement.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe Knowledge podcast by Wahoo is a science-based podcast focused on providing training information for endurance athletes.

              "description": "This session is all about high-torque efforts, very similar to the efforts you would experience riding up the steep slopes of Mt Sufferlandria. While these efforts are short and the intensity isn\u2019t too high, the low cadence targets combined with minimal recovery will leave some begging for the high-cadence sprints of _The Omnium_. High-torque efforts like these have two primary benefits: improved neuromuscular coordination and increased muscular endurance.\n\n\u200B\n\nDuring each pedal revolution, your legs have to \u201Cswitch on\u201D and \u201Cswitch off\u201D almost all of the muscles in your legs. High-cadence efforts in something like _Cadence Builds_ are great for teaching these groups to make that switch quickly. These low-cadence efforts are better for teaching ALL of the muscles in your legs to \u201Cswitch on.\u201D Done properly, you should be pulling with your hamstrings with one leg while the other leg is pushing down with all the force your glutes and quads can muster. If you feel like you are pushing yourself up out of the saddle during harder efforts (like seated sprints), your hamstrings are not being utilized since they should pull you back down into your saddle.\n\n\u200B\n\nThe second main benefit is improved muscular endurance. Even though the session is under 45 minutes, **you\u0027ll put a similar amount of muscular fatigue into your legs as a steady, multi-hour base ride.** You can almost view this session as hitting the leg press for 8 sets of 100 reps. And just like the weight room, proper form is absolutely key. That means:\n\n- You should focus on pushing down AND pulling back up. You want your glutes and quads activated on the way down and your hamstring and hip flexors activated on the way up.\n- To properly engage your hamstrings think about trying to pulling your heel up to your butt when your crank arm is going from 6 o\u2019clock to 10 o\u2019clock.\n- Your knees should be tracking straight up and down, no collapsing in or out.\n- Your core should be fully engaged to keep your hips steady in the saddle. This will be easier if you are both pushing and pulling during each pedal revolution.\n\nThis session is very similar to _Power Station_. Both help improve your muscular endurance and coordination; the biggest difference is the work to rest ratio between the two. While the intervals here are shorter than those in _Power Station_, the decreased recovery duration means fatigue will build faster, especially for those with a weakness in repeated efforts.\n\nModifying interval length and recovery duration can also be seen between sessions like _Revolver_ and _A Very Dark Place_. Both serve up a healthy dose of MAP/VO2 work, but the overall feeling of those two sessions is different.\n\nIf you find that your lower back starts to ache during this session or that you have to start rocking in the saddle to keep the power up, then it\u2019s time for you to get started on the SYSTM Yoga program. Kick it off with \u201CCore Strengtheners \u201D to make sure your core is just as strong as those legs.\n\n\u200B\n\n**LEARN MORE**\n\nListen to \u0027[When to Train with Low Cadence](https://the-knowledge-by-wahoo-sports-science.simplecast.com/episodes/when-to-train-with-low-cadence)\u0027 on The Knowledge Podcast by Wahoo Sports Science.\n",

The result? Improved core strength, stability, and endurance. You\u0027ll find exercises that carry over into other areas of your body, but all of the moves have a significant impact on your core. Level 1 is ideal for very beginners. Even then, you may find some of these moves challenging if you have never attempted them. That\u2019s ok, take your time and pause the video if you need. Soon you\u2019ll be on your way to mastering your core potential.

              "description": "This is an active recovery ride built with purpose. Low-intensity endurance work is paired with brief high-cadence neuromuscular activations to keep the nervous system awake without creating new fatigue. You\u2019ll stay well below threshold throughout, allowing your body to absorb previous hard sessions and prepare for what\u2019s ahead.\n\n\u200B\n\nSet on the peaceful roads leading to the summit of Port de la Vall d\u2019Ebo, this ride promotes circulation, technique, and mental reset. It\u2019s ideal after race days or big training blocks \u2014 a smart session that helps you recover better, so you can train harder tomorrow. No ego, no watts chasing \u2014 just intentional recovery done right.\n\n\u200B\n\n[**Wahoo Route**](https://www.strava.com/activities/13996505846)\n\n\u200B\n\n_Your Host: There are few people who know the mountains and roads of Europe better than Wahoo Ambassador Michael Cotty. As founder of The Col Collective, Mike has made a career out of riding, filming, and telling the story of epic rides and mountains across the continent. As your On Location co-creator and host, Mike\u0027s engaging character, curious mind, and friendly nature will have you cueing up your next ride with him before you\u0027ve even finished the cool-down._\n",

              "description": "\uD83C\uDFAC Film (2025): This film is a visually stunning endurance sports film that reimagines what it means to swim, bike, and run. Professional triathlete Eric Lagerstrom sets out on a summer of self-discovery across Colorado, Arizona, and British Columbia, reconnecting with the curiosity that first pulled him into the sport.\n\nAlong the way, he rides remote gravel roads with endurance legend Heather Jackson, dives into icy open water with Olympic gold medalist Simon Whitfield, and runs high alpine ridgelines far from any race course. Together, they explore a deeper purpose in sport\u2014one rooted in wonder, not competition.\n\nShot across three breathtaking locations, this is triathlon like you\u2019ve never seen it: wild, creative, and free.\n\nThis is multi-sport without rules. Movement without limits. Adventure without a stopwatch.\n\n\u200B\n\n\uD83D\uDEB4 Workout: the workout accompanying this film varies from endurance to tempo to sub-threshold. The higher intensity efforts aren\u0027t the hardest you\u0027ll experience so that you can keep your attention on the film, however, they are just hard enough to help improve your FTP, oxygen utilization efficiency, and the ability to recover quickly between hard efforts. The workout intensity reflects the intensity of the riders in many places, so you may feel as if you\u0027re climbing Mont Ventoux or that you\u0027re a part of Cav\u0027s lead-out train on the run into the finish line.\n\n\u200B\n\n[Here\u0027s how to turn off on-screen graphics for the best viewing experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterInspiration)\n",
